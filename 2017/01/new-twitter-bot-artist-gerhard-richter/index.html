  <p>This week I went to the SFMOMA for the first time. It’s great! I spent hours there and felt like I had to rush to see even a fraction of the collection. One of the pieces that really struck me was <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/FC.643">Gerhard Richter’s massive 1974 painting “256 Colors”</a> (or “256 Farben” in his original German). I took a picture of it there:</p>

<p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_3465-1.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_3465-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
He made a few “256 Colors” and a bunch of other color charts, some of which are more explicitly generative—that is, where the colors and their arrangement are left to chance.</p>

<p>Anyway, that sounded like fun, so I’ve put together a <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/256farben">small script that creates paintings</a> that look a bit like “256 Colors.” Here’s one that it made:</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/render-1024x555.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And naturally, I’ve made a Twitter bot that posts them twice a day: <a href="https://twitter.com/256farben">@256farben</a>. Follow along for two daily reminders of the beauty of randomness.</p>
