  <p>One of my goals while at Recurse Center has been to improve my ability to manipulate and visualize data sets. To that end, I’ve been toying around with the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">Social Security Administration’s baby name dataset</a>, which records the number of babies born with each given name every year, both federally and at the state level. Because I’ve also been watching <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> along with the <a href="http://foreverdogproductions.com/fdpn/podcasts/treks-and-the-city/">Treks And The City podcast</a>, I chose to dig into information about the name “Wesley.”</p>

<p>On my first pass through the data I noticed that the name’s popularity dramatically spiked around 1976, and then tapered off for a few decades after. Honestly, that spike is the most interesting property of the whole graph, and I can’t explain it very well. But a funny secondary effect is that neither <em>TNG</em>‘s premiere nor the release of <em>The Princess Bride</em>—both in 1987—could prop up the name as it declined in popularity. The effect makes it look like it’s tumbling off a cliff, instead of regressing to the mean. This graph, including the label, was generated in Python’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matplotlib</code>.</p>

<p>After looking at the federal data, I decided to dig into the state-level stuff, to give me a (long-anticipated!) opportunity to generate a choropleth map. Again, I cleaned up the data in Python, and then generated a map using a Javascript library called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href="https://d3-geomap.github.io/"&gt;d3-geomap&lt;/a&gt;</code>. For a long time I’ve wanted to get more familiar with its parent library, d3, and this has been a nice opportunity to dip my toe into that.</p>
