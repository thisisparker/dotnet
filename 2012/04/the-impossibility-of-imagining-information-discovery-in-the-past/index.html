  <p>It’s harder to imagine the past that went away than it is to imagine the future. What we were prior to our latest batch of technology is, in a way, unknowable.

  <p>My great-grandfather was born into a world where there was no recorded music. It’s very, very difficult to conceive of a world in which there is no possibility of audio recording at all. Some people were extremely upset by the first Edison recordings. It nauseated them, terrified them.

<p>–<a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6089/the-art-of-fiction-no-211-william-gibson">William Gibson, interviewed in the Paris Review no. 211</a></p>

<p>There’s a whole class of information that’s both trivially easy for Web-literate people to access today and virtually impossible to access with tools from even 10 or 15 years ago.</p>

<p>I’ve thought about this fact for a while, and one of my favorite examples has been the names of members of a band. It’s one Google or Wikipedia search away, but as Gibson suggests above, I almost cannot conceive of how to determine this without those tools.</p>

<p>Seriously: what could you do? Such information would not likely be in an encyclopedia, and maybe not in any printed reference books. You could ask at a record store, or call a radio station or the label they were on (after finding a number on the back of an LP, in a catalog, or calling an operator in the city in which they were based).</p>

<p>I’d used that example to describe the phenomenon for a long time before finding one of my favorite sections of the Wikipedia, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_%28band%29#Timeline">timeline of the members of Journey</a>, ((It’s also dynamically generated with a plug-in called Timeline, which makes it semantically significant and editable. It’s a pretty incredible thing.)) embedded teeny-tiny here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_%28band%29#Timeline"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-28-at-7.38.48-PM.png" alt="" title="Timeline of the members of Journey" /></a></p>

<p>The difference is incredible. And it’s easier (for me at least) to imagine getting this information through an augmented reality pop-up or piped into a heads-up display than to get it in any analog way.</p>
