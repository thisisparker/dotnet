  <time datetime="2012-07-06T21:29:58-04:00" class="post-date">06 Jul 2012</time>
  <p>Two articles that crossed my desk today described the difference between the two kinds of hackers. Howard Rheingold offered this distinction in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/07/what-the-wells-rise-and-fall-tell-us-about-online-community/259504/">his memoir of the WELL</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(when “hacking” meant creative programming rather than online breaking and entering)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <cite>New York Times</cite> chose to explain it in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/technology/at-hacker-hostels-living-on-the-cheap-and-dreaming-of-digital-glory.html?pagewanted=all">a story about “hacker hostels”</a> ((Incidentally, fellow Iron Blogger Rich Jones provides <a href="https://gun.io/blog/what-real-hacker-hostels-would-look-like/">another perspective on what hackers would really want in a “hacker hostel”</a> on his own site.)) this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the Mark Zuckerberg variety, not the identity thieves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously both of these descriptions are simplistic, and maybe necessarily so, given the requirements of the overall pieces. But the <cite>New York Times</cite> distinction is just silly: the only “good” hacker is a capitalist hacker, I guess. Rheingold for his part may simply be acknowledging an evolving and warped perspective perpetuated by the media. As my colleague <a href="http://oddletters.com/">Molly Sauter</a> explained in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/if-hackers-didnt-exist-governments-would-have-to-invent-them/259463/">a piece about the hacker as a modern folk devil</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hackers who dominate news coverage and popular culture — malicious, adolescent techno-wizards, willing and able to do great harm to innocent civilians and society at large — don’t exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The playful curiosity that actually defines a “hacker” to me seems to be a hard thing to understand for many people, and the polysemy of the word doesn’t help.</p>
