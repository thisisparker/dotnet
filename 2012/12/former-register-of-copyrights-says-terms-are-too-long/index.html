  <p>In November 2005, Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters gave an impressively candid answer about copyright terms being too long, and that she thought such a situation was a “big mistake.” Unfortunately link rot has begun to set in, and it was somewhat difficult for me to track down a copy of the video.</p>

<p>(When <a href="http://boingboing.net/2006/02/21/copyright-office-hea.html">BoingBoing linked to the video</a> in February of 2006, YouTube was in its first year of existence, and far from the ubiquity it’s since achieved. Instead, the post points to AVI, MP4, and MPG files [formerly] hosted on <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/">iBiblio</a>.)</p>

<p>I was able to dig up a version crawled by the Internet Archive, and have <a href="http://archive.org/details/MarybethPetersFormerUsRegisterOfCopyrightsOnTermsBeingTooLong">posted the video more prominently</a> on that site.</p>
