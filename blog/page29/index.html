        A visit from San Francisco&#8217;s wild parrots

    <time datetime="2013-04-07T14:06:21-04:00" class="post-date">07 Apr 2013</time>

    <p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/three-birds.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/three-birds-300x208.jpg" alt="three-birds" /></a>Earlier this week I was treated to a visit from some two dozen of San Francisco’s wild parrots, the cherry-headed conures that live on and around Telegraph Hill. It was pretty spectacular — I was sitting at the kitchen table by the window, and first one, then two, then maybe a half dozen landed right outside on my balcony, occasionally conferring with a larger group that had set down on the roof.</p>

<p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/two-birds.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/two-birds-204x300.jpg" alt="two-birds" /></a>I had heard of these birds, but had never seen them for more than a few seconds as a flash of green coming out of a tree. I took all these pictures from the table with my phone, not wanting to get up and startle them, but they stuck around for some 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I hadn’t seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Parrots_of_Telegraph_Hill">the documentary about them</a>, though I had long been meaning to. I made a point to watch it last night, and enjoyed it, and it is definitely weird.</p>

    <p>As with <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/04/april-fools-day-effector/">last year</a>, I played a central role in putting together this year’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/effector/26/09">April Fools’ edition</a> of <a href="https://www.eff.org/effector">the EFF newsletter</a>. It’s hard writing things that are supposed to be funny.</p>

<p>I also feel, and I can’t tell if this is just confirmation bias, like maybe people are pretty much over April Fools’ Day jokes online. I had fun putting together this newsletter, but it seems like each year there are fewer jokes on other sites that I actually enjoy.</p>

<p>(ThinkGeek is usually an exception. Let’s see what they’ve got this year.)</p>

    <time datetime="2013-03-19T12:54:48-04:00" class="post-date">19 Mar 2013</time>

    <p>It’s really great to read <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf">today’s Supreme Court decision in Kirtsaeng</a>, in which a bad opinion could have had very profound and negative consequences way beyond the normal contours of copyright. I attended the oral arguments in October (during Hurricane Sandy!) and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/parade-horribles-supreme-court-first-sale-kirtsaeng-v-wiley">wrote it up for EFF</a>. I’ve been eagerly awaiting the decision since then, and I’m not disappointed. Here’s one of my favorite paragraphs from the decision:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, the fact that harm has proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders so far to assert geographically based resale rights. They may decide differently if the law is clarified in their favor. Regardless, a copyright law that can work in practice only if unenforced is not a sound copyright law. It is a law that would create uncertainty, would bring about selective enforcement, and, if widely unenforced, would breed disrespect for copyright law itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good news. Somebody in the office here called it “the first good Supreme Court decision on copyright in two decades.” I’ll take it.</p>

        Arranging the keys
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2013-03-03T23:16:46-05:00" class="post-date">03 Mar 2013</time>

    <p>Like many around the web, I was struck last month by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/john-e-karlin-who-led-the-way-to-all-digit-dialing-dies-at-94.html?pagewanted=all">the obituary of Bell Labs engineer John E. Karlin</a>, whose greatest legacy may be the keypad design on traditional touch-tone phones. (That is, the arrangement in a 3×3 grid with the 1-2-3 across the top instead of the bottom.) I had long heard the urban legend explanation that the arrangement was deliberately designed to slow down a population trained to quickly enter strings of numbers on calculators and cash registers and prevent them from overwhelming the phone system. It’s nice to hear that not only was there deliberate thought behind it, but real behavioral research.</p>

<p>(There are similar legends, too, about the QWERTY keyboard being developed to intentionally slow down typists to avoid jamming the keys. This is <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/221/was-the-qwerty-keyboard-purposely-designed-to-slow-typists">at least controversial</a> and <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/keys1.html">probably wrong</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arrow_keys.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arrow_keys-300x205.jpg" alt="Arrow_keys" /></a>His story also reminded me of the creation of another well-known keypad arrangement: the arrow keys on computer keyboards. To me the familiar inverted-T seems like the only plausible arrangement, but there were actually a handful of different options in production for a while. <a href="http://www.eldacur.com/~brons/index.html">Jim “Brons” Burrows</a> was an engineer at DEC which developed the inverted-T keypad that later became the industry standard, and <a href="http://www.eldacur.com/~brons/NerdCorner/InverseT-History.html">his first-person account of that development process</a> is a really interesting read.</p>

        An update on the Christopher Dorner drone situation
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2013-02-17T18:09:58-05:00" class="post-date">17 Feb 2013</time>

    <p>Last week <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2013/02/did-the-internet-just-fall-for-a-massive-drone-hoax/">I dug into some claims that struck me as bogus</a>, claiming that the LAPD was flying drones to track Christopher Dorner through Southern California. It looks like my suspicions were correct. <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/02/11/lapd-drones-dorner/">Lorenzo Francheschi-Bicchierai at Mashable posted a write-up just a few hours after mine</a>, but since he’s a real journalist he called the CBP and checked with them: they stated that “CPB UAS are not flying in support of the search.”</p>

<p>Of course, the CBP drones weren’t the only option. The day after Lorenzo’s story, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/02/12/christopher_dorner_manhunt_faa_dhs_say_no_drones_are_being_used.html">Ryan Gallagher at Slate got in touch with the FAA</a>, who said that “no agency has asked us to issue a certificate of authorization for operating UAS as part of this search.” That pretty much rules out the option that the LAPD was flying drones, even if they were officially refusing to confirm or deny the story.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the morning after Dorner was discovered and killed, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-domestic-drones-20130216,0,1021089,full.story">the LAPD confirmed that it was not flying a drone, but that it wished it could have</a>. A police spokesman said, “The search would have been much wider and quicker because you’d have an unmanned aircraft looking. You can cover more ground.”</p>

<p>Given that Dorner was discovered in close proximity to a police outpost, it seems unlikely that a drone covering more territory would have been much help. But now we know, more or less, that it wasn’t used in this case.</p>
