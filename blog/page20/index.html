        The Supreme Court&#8217;s real technology problem
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2014-04-30T20:24:21-04:00" class="post-date">30 Apr 2014</time>

    <p>I spent a lot of the last week shaking my head at the commentary on the Supreme Court and its (lack of) technical expertise. Much of the criticism came in response to the oral arguments in <em>Aereo</em>, and broke down in two areas: it either <a href="http://sarahjeong.net/2014/04/22/supreme-court-justices-are-not-good-with-computers/">misunderstood the nature of Supreme Court oral arguments and their transcripts</a>, or <a href="http://sarahjeong.net/2014/04/23/scotus-is-bad-at-computers-part-2/">mistook familiarity with a handful of Silicon Valley products with actual tech savviness</a>.</p>

<p>But in a series of cases yesterday about law enforcement searches of cell phones, we caught a glimpse of the Supreme Court’s real technology problem. Here’s what it comes down to: it’s not essential that the Court knows specifics about how technology itself works—and as Timothy Lee argues, that <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/4/23/5644154/the-supreme-courts-technical-cluelessness-makes-them-better-justices">might even tempt them to make technology-based decisions that don’t generalize well</a>. However, it <em>is</em> essential that the Court understands how people use technology, especially in areas where they’re trying to elaborate a standard of what expectations are “reasonable.”</p>

<p>So when Chief Justice Roberts suggests that <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/461257425517961216">a person carrying two cell phones might reasonably be suspected of dealing drugs</a>, that raises major red flags. Not because of any special facts about how cell phones work, but because (for example) at least half of the lawyers in the Supreme Court Bar brought two cell phones with them to the courthouse that day. Should those attorneys (along with the many, many other people who carry multiple devices) reasonably expect less privacy because the Chief Justice is out of touch with that fact?</p>

<p>Contrast that with <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/461239651043250179">Justice Kagan’s point about storage location in the same argument</a>. Justice Kagan suggested, correctly, that people don’t always know what is stored on their device and what is stored “in the cloud.” The actual answer to that question should be immaterial; the point is that it’s absurd for a person’s privacy interest to hinge on which hard drive private data is stored on. ((That speaks to a need to revisit the sort-of ridiculous third-party doctrine, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/01/23/a-supreme-court-justices-radical-proposal-regarding-the-privacy-of-your-google-searches-facebook-account-phone-records/">which Justice Sotomayor has suggested</a>, but one battle at a time.)) Instead, the important fact here, which Justice Kagan recognizes, is that the distinction between local and cloud storage just doesn’t matter to many people, and so it can’t be the basis of a reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test.</p>

<p>If you’re feeling less generous, you might take Justice Kagan’s point as evidence that she herself doesn’t know where her files are stored. And in fact, that’s probably true—but it’s not important. You don’t actually need to know much about filesystems and remote storage to know that it’s a bad idea for the law to treat it differently.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that technical implementation details are never relevant. Relevant details, though, should (and almost always do) get addressed in the briefs, long before the oral argument takes place. They don’t usually read like software manuals, either: they’re often rich with analogies to help explain not just how the tech works, but what body of law should apply.</p>

<p>What can’t really be explained in a brief, though, is a community’s relationship with a technology. You can get at parts of it, citing authorities like surveys and expert witnesses, but a real feeling for what people expect from their software and devices is something that has to be observed. If the nine justices on the Supreme Court can’t bring that knowledge to the arguments, the public suffers greatly. Again, Justice Kagan seems to recognize this fact when she says of cell phones:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They’re computers. They have as much computing capacity as ­­ as laptops did five years ago. And ­­ and everybody under a certain age, let’s say under 40, has everything on them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Justice Kagan is not under 40, and might not have everything stored on a phone (or on an online service accessible through her phone). But that quote shows me that she at least knows where other people’s expectations are different. Chief Justice Roberts’s questions show me exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>The justices live an unusual and sheltered life: they have no concerns about job security, and spend much of their time grappling with abstract questions that have profound effects on this country’s law. But if they fail to recognize where their assumptions about society and technology break from the norm—or indeed, where they are making assumptions in the first place—we’re all in trouble.</p>

    <time datetime="2014-04-29T02:17:27-04:00" class="post-date">29 Apr 2014</time>

    <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="http://dinopoloclub.com/minimetro/">Mini Metro</a>, a (still alpha) transit-planning puzzle game. It’s been recommended to me a dozen times by people who know how I feel about transit maps, and that element of the game is really great, but it’s also just a lot of fun to play.</p>

<p>In any case, it’s got a very distinctive style, and I wanted to see more maps with that look. So I made a version of the San Francisco BART map in that look.</p>

        Where is the copyright maximalist dystopian sci-fi?
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2014-04-28T12:17:27-04:00" class="post-date">28 Apr 2014</time>

    <p>Have copyright maximalists ever written dystopian science-fiction about a future where free culture wins?</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1930-Nov-3-Syracuse-Herald-Syracuse-NY-sm.jpg" alt="1930-Nov-3-Syracuse-Herald-Syracuse-NY-sm" /></p>

<p>After all, there’s plenty of science-fiction in the copyfight. Whole subgenres of utopian stories assume a post-scarcity world facilitated by tech like super-advanced 3D printing and unhindered by law. Similarly, there are plenty of stories that describe a dystopian future where information is locked down by ever more oppressive “intellectual property” laws.</p>

<p>(Some very short stories to give the flavor: <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/nanolaw.html">“Nanolaw with Daughter” by Paul Ford</a> is a great one that imagines lawsuits proliferating unendingly; <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7073/full/439242a.html">“Printcrime,” among many others by Cory Doctorow</a>, looks at one future of 3D printing; and the Future of Copyright anthologies, now collected twice by the Modern Poland Foundation, has <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/23/future-ip-stories/">always gotten some dystopian future contributions</a>. After I posted this, I got several reminders about <a href="http://www.spiderrobinson.com/melancholyelephants.html">“Melancholy Elephants” by Spider Robinson</a>, which is an all-time classic.)</p>

<p>But where’s the dystopian future imagined by the other side? Of course, I’m inclined to believe that it doesn’t exist because, despite all the doom and gloom pitched by the legacy content industries, people realize that copyright (et al.) are not playing <em>that</em> important a role holding society together. I think that’s supported by the few efforts that have been made.</p>

<p>Take for example this, uh, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/opinion/15turow.html">piece of counterfactual storytelling in the New York Times</a> by Authors Guild president Scott Turow, imagining if Shakespeare had to contend with the web. The premise unravels around the time you realize that <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110215/11165113112/would-shakespeare-have-survived-todays-copyright-laws.shtml">Shakespeare would have been just as confused by the concept of “copyright,”</a> seeing as he predated it by about 200 years (and managed to write a few plays anyway!).</p>

<p>Is that it? Is the reason we don’t have dystopian sci-fi about free culture winning is because it would have to acknowledge that you can get Shakespeare and Bach and Mozart and Michelangelo, but nothing <em>really</em> good?</p>

<p>One example I found that nearly fit the bill is <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/musicians-wage-war-against-evil-robots-92702721/&quot;">a robot-themed series of ads placed by the Music Defense League</a>, a subset of the American Federation of Musicians, attacking the use of recorded music in movie theaters. It’s not strictly about copyright, but it imagined a death of human creativity and virtuosity at the hands of recording and performance technology, which is maybe close enough. The one at the top is my favorite in the series, but <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/musicians-wage-war-against-evil-robots-92702721/">all the ones picked out by Smithsonian Magazine are remarkable</a>.</p>

<p>John Philip Sousa’s <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=zmEoAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">famous 1906 testimony to the US House of Representatives</a>, railing on recorded music, brushes up against sci-fi. There’s the portion Lessig quotes in <a href="http://free-culture.cc/"><em>Free Culture</em></a> and in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity">his TED talk</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In front of every house in the summer evenings you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or the old songs. Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal chord left. The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the ape The vocal chords will go because no one will have a chance to sing, the phonograph supplying a mechanical imitation of the voice, accompaniment, and effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But again, this is not really a copyright argument at all, just one generally against technology.</p>

<p>Does anything more recent and on point exist? If so, I’d be interested to read it. If it doesn’t, I hope somebody some day fills the niche. As much as it’d break my heart, Ursula K. LeGuin—who has expressed <a href="http://bookviewcafe.com/blog/2011/03/28/unfacts-concerning-the-google-unsettlement/">strong feelings</a> <a href="http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Note-OpenLetter.html">about copyright</a>—could probably do a bang-up job of it. It’s hard to imagine I’d find the arguments in it very compelling, but I’d love to give it a shot.</p>

    <p>Here’s a supercut of audio from April 22, 2014’s Supreme Court argument in <em><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/american-broadcasting-companies-inc-v-aereo-inc/">ABC v. Aereo</a></em> featuring every use (in order) of the word “cloud.” The video track is from <a href="http://www.coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/supermarioclouds/">Cory Arcangel’s “Super Mario Clouds” (2002)</a>.</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="435" loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nJ_eX7HFTbQ?rel=0" width="580"></iframe>

<p>Here’s a version of the audio only (yes, I put my cloud sound on SoundCloud):</p>

I edited the audio in Audacity, and the transcript is indexed, so I had a list of all the uses of the word “cloud” that I could check off as I went.</p>

<p>Once I had the audio, I grabbed a copy of Cory Arcangel’s video and used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mencoder</code> to put them together. The commands I used to add the audio was:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mencoder -ovc copy -audiofile supremecourtclouds.mp3 -oac copy supermarioclouds.mp4 -o supremecourtclouds-unclipped.mp4</code></p>

<p>And to clip the video to the length of the audio, I did:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mencoder -endpos 00:00:56 -ovc copy -oac copy supremecourtclouds-unclipped.mp4 -o supremecourtclouds.mp4</code></p>

<p>Attending oral arguments on Tuesday was a great experience. Glad I’ve got this little memento.</p>
