        The pirate drawings of 1922

    <time datetime="2013-05-30T20:43:52-04:00" class="post-date">30 May 2013</time>

    <p>Yesterday I posted a <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2013/05/ship-in-a-bottle/">ship in a bottle</a> from the <a href="http://archive.org/details/pirates00john">1922 book “Pirates,”</a> and today I’ve had a chance to clean up a few more images, including most of the actual named pirates described in the book. The book seems to be scanned on a setting for text, and so the pictures require just a little bit of correction and cleaning. I’m pretty happy with the way these images turned out. Of course, since the book was released in 1922, all of these are in the public domain. So if you need a pirate drawing, go ahead.</p>

<p>I cleaned up this illustration from a scan of the title page of <a href="http://archive.org/details/pirates00john"><em>Pirates</em></a> (1922). The illustrator is the great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claud_Lovat_Fraser">Claud Lovat Fraser</a>. The book came out the year after he died.</p>

    <p>Working on drones, and increasingly in the conversation around Google Glass, I keep hearing a common refrain from people who don’t understand other people’s concerns. “There are surveillance cameras on every corner in major cities, helicopters with cameras overhead, and constant tracking in a million other ways,” the argument goes, “and where is the outrage about those things?”</p>

<p>I find this very strange. For one thing, it seems to imply that society’s got one shot to weigh in on a new branch of technology when its root is being formed. Like there’s a speak-now-or-forever-hold-your-peace moment where if the outrage isn’t sufficiently intense then we have to take our lumps and accept new developments forever. Of course, though, that’s crazy.</p>

<p>But for another thing, I can tell you where the outrage was. A lot of the concerns around drones and Glass that are being picked up and amplified now are the exact same concerns that people were voicing around ubiquitous CCTV cameras and warrantless wiretapping and the TSA and what-have-you.</p>

<p>I don’t think, generally, you should be able to silence an argument because somebody wasn’t making a similar argument earlier. But it seems especially ill-advised to me to try to catch the privacy community in such a loophole. The group of people that are actively outraged about privacy violations may be small, but it is fiercely principled.</p>

<p>So, in response to “Where was the outrage then?” First, it doesn’t matter. Here is the outrage now. But second, it was always there, simmering beneath the surface, and if you haven’t seen it then maybe you’re not the expert on these issues that you thought you were.</p>

        How to defeat terrorism
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2013-04-16T01:19:18-04:00" class="post-date">16 Apr 2013</time>

    <p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/the-boston-marathon-bombing-keep-calm-and-carry-on/275014/">Bruce Schneier’s essay</a> on today’s bombings in Boston helped shake me out of the daze I found myself in since hearing the news this morning. I am far away from Boston, and knew nobody in the blast radius, but the ability to keep refreshing feeds to read more news, hear more rumors, see more pictures, made the tragedy feel immediate.</p>

<p>Acts of terror are extremely uncommon, but they manage to play on that immediacy to cause real, self-inflicted damage that ripples out to orders of magnitude more people. The cruel measure of “success” for an act of terror, then, isn’t how much harm is done in the explosion itself, but whether society’s reaction allows the terrible memories to fester and continue to disrupt our lives.</p>

<p>As Schneier notes, we can’t attain absolute security, and we can’t guarantee our safety from people who want to destroy it. But we can rein in the ratcheting of the security theater that follows, and demonstrate that terrorism is ineffective against people who refuse to be terrorized.</p>

<p>Expanding on that just a bit: one of the most pernicious effects of terrorism is to undermine the bonds of trust and good faith in society. So one way to fight that is to celebrate the first responders and other heroes to come out of today. Celebrating the <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/04/photos-stories-kindness-boston-marathon-bombing/64258/">stories of kindness from after the bombing</a>, many of which are truly remarkable. As has been widely noted, in the footage of the explosion, you can see people running towards the smoke, looking to help whoever has been caught. Noting that selflessness helps avoid perpetuating a terrible and cynical impression of human nature. Cory Doctorow wrote recently about <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2013/03/cory-doctorow-ten-years-on/">the dangers of that misguided belief</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the worst kind of lie: the lie that makes itself true. When enough people believe the libel against the human race, the vile calumny that ‘‘human nature’’ would have us all at each others’ throats were it not for coercive force, it becomes a truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people online shared <a href="http://www.pbs.org/parents/rogers/special/scarynews-thoughts.html">a beautiful quote from Mr. Fred Rogers</a> about dealing with scary news. It’s been clipped in a few places, but I think the whole thing is worth sharing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’ To this day, especially in times of ‘disaster,’ I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers—so many caring people in this world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today as we look, even through tears, for the helpers, for the caring people in the world, we are not disappointed.</p>

<p>These are the things I think about, but just as important are the things I do. In the shockwave of today’s news, I made two decisions about concrete things I will do.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Donate blood</strong>. I try to do so every 56 days, but it slips. When tragedy strikes, though, it’s a good reminder that you can do something that can literally save a life. Of course, my blood in San Francisco won’t do much for the people in Boston, but it’s a good thing to do for the world. (Incidentally, Red Cross doesn’t seem to have much of a presence in the city in terms of blood drives. I’m giving through <a href="http://www.bloodcenters.org/">Blood Centers of the Pacific</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>Sign up for the San Francisco Marathon</strong>. It’s a show of solidarity, and a statement that fear of violence can’t stop us. I may end up doing the <a href="http://www.thesfmarathon.com/events/1st-half-marathon/">half marathon</a> instead, but the important point is this: I will be lined up with the other runners come race day.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today was a hard day, and of course it was infinitely harder for the hundreds and thousands of people whose lives were directly affected. Even on the hardest days, though, there is hope if you can find it. I was very touched to find that sentiment expressed beautifully in <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/wind-clock-for-tomorrow-is-another-day.html">this letter from E. B. White</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is quite obvious that the human race has made a queer mess of life on this planet. But as a people we probably harbor seeds of goodness that have lain for a long time waiting to sprout when the conditions are right. Man’s curiosity, his relentlessness, his inventiveness, his ingenuity have led him into deep trouble. We can only hope that these same traits will enable him to claw his way out.</p>

  <p>Hang on to your hat. Hang on to your hope. And wind the clock, for tomorrow is another day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wind the clock, for tomorrow is another day.</p>

        The amazing library in Psy&#8217;s &#8220;Gentleman&#8221; video
      </a>

    <time datetime="2013-04-14T15:13:11-04:00" class="post-date">14 Apr 2013</time>

    <p>Psy — he, of course, of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0">Gangnam Style</a>” fame — is back with a second video called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASO_zypdnsQ">Gentleman</a>.” A day into its existence, it’s pushing 30 million views. Anyway, there are a few shots of a pretty incredible location that caught my eye. Psy and his crew are dancing on a set of steps, surrounded by shelves full of books.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/psy-in-seoul-metropolitan-gentleman.jpg" alt="Psy dancing in the Seoul Metropolitan Library in &quot;Gentleman&quot;" /></p>

<p>At first I thought this was a bookstore, but a little digging revealed that they’re dancing in <a href="http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Society/view?articleId=103347">the new Seoul Metropolitan Library, which is housed in the former City Hall building</a>. That building was built under Japanese Colonial Rule in 1926, and later served as the headquarters for the municipal government until 2008. There were plans for the building to be demolished, but those plans proved unpopular.</p>

<p>In October 2012, Psy performed <a href="http://gawker.com/5949254/psy-performs-free-thank-you-concert-in-seoul-literally-shuts-the-city-down">his free “thank you” concert</a> in front of this building, drawing 80,000 fans and shutting down major parts of the city.</p>

<p>Later that month, it was re-opened as a library, and now houses 200,000 books on seven floors. It looks like a pretty incredible space.</p>

<p>As somebody on Twitter notes, though, the library’s about <a href="https://twitter.com/NextStopOrBust/status/323278272270041090">a 40-50 minute subway ride from Gangnam</a>.</p>
