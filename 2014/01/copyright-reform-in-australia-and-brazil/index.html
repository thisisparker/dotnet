  <time datetime="2014-01-20T04:18:35-05:00" class="post-date">20 Jan 2014</time>
  <p>One of the excellent things about running <a href="https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek">Copyright Week</a>—and there were many—is that copyright activists around the world gave some top-level overviews about what is going on in their countries. Two of my favorite came from regions where copyright reform has been long promised but yet to materialize: Australia and Brazil.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://blog.iinet.net.au/copyright-copywrong/">what’s going on in Australia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.alrc.gov.au/news-media/2011-2013/copyright-enews-issue-9-final-report-delivered-g">Australian Law Reform Commission</a> (ALRC) has now delivered its final report on Copyright to the government. Current copyright exceptions have not kept pace with the digital world, and don’t adequately protect important internet-related activities such as <a href="http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/issues-paper/caching-indexing-and-other-internet-functions">caching</a> or <a href="http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/issues-paper/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>. From a consumer perspective, sharing photos (when you don’t own the copyright) on sites such as Facebook and Tumblr is <a href="http://faircopyright.com.au/social-media-sharing">off-limits</a> – unless you have permission from the rights-holder. Or, in a professional context, you can watch a video on YouTube, but you <a href="http://faircopyright.com.au/no-youtube-conference">can’t include it</a> in a presentation to colleagues at work, or for a conference. (Check out other examples of how Australia’s current copyright law is out of touch at the Australian Digital Alliance’s <a href="http://faircopyright.com.au/">#copywrong</a> site.)</p>

  <p>The Attorney-General <a href="http://digital.org.au/content/alrc-recommends-fair-use">announced</a> in December that the ALRC recommended “the introduction of a flexible fair-use exception as a defence to copyright infringement”, similar to that in place in the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://creativecommons.org.br/blog/copyright-week-en/">here’s what’s going on in Brazil</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…what is most troubling about the future ahead is that the entire copyright reform process could lose considerable momentum in 2014. A lot was already lost during 2013, considering civil society has turned its focus to Marco Civil. On top of that, the Snowden leaks and the upcoming <a href="http://brmeeting.br/">Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance</a>, to be held in São Paulo, have turned copyright into a secondary concern. Privacy and surveillance seem to have taken the front stage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s great to follow copyright around the world, especially as deals like <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp">the Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> threaten to export laws from all different countries. So it’s nice to have people in these countries laying out what’s happening on the ground there.</p>
