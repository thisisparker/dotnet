  <h2 class="post-title">Requiem for Emphasis</h2>
  <time datetime="2014-02-23T23:49:43-05:00" class="post-date">23 Feb 2014</time>
  <p>The New York Times launched <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/times-designers-are-monitoring-reaction-to-the-redesign-with-adjustments-possible/">a major redesign last month</a> and, as is the way with these things, got <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/20/after-the-times-redesign-complaints-and-changes/">a bunch of angry comments</a> from pitchfork-wielding Times readers who wanted to be able to print articles with a single click instead of two. And though public editor Margaret Sullivan claims to have sifted through though thousands of comments, my one little nitpick hasn’t been addressed.</p>

<p>For years the Times has had <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/">a hidden feature called “Emphasis,”</a> which would allow readers to click shift twice and then highlight and deeplink to individual sentences and paragraphs. It’s really great for a site like the New York Times to be able to pick out one well-reported detail in a longer piece and direct people’s attention directly there.</p>

<p>I liked it so much I found a WordPress plugin that incorporates the feature and <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/11/new-plugin-wp-emphasis/">added it to this blog</a>. I am skeptical that anybody has ever used it here, but it’s been an option. (You can try it out by clicking shift twice.)</p>

<p>In any case, Emphasis is gone from the new redesign, and as far as I can tell hasn’t been mentioned since. <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/the-technology-behind-the-nytimes-com-redesign/">The technical recap</a> describes a ground-up rewrite, and it probably was just not a priority. I suspect it was never a very popular feature, but I, for one, miss it.</p>
