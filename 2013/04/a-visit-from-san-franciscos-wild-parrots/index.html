  <p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/three-birds.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/three-birds-300x208.jpg" alt="three-birds" /></a>Earlier this week I was treated to a visit from some two dozen of San Francisco’s wild parrots, the cherry-headed conures that live on and around Telegraph Hill. It was pretty spectacular — I was sitting at the kitchen table by the window, and first one, then two, then maybe a half dozen landed right outside on my balcony, occasionally conferring with a larger group that had set down on the roof.</p>

<p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/two-birds.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/two-birds-204x300.jpg" alt="two-birds" /></a>I had heard of these birds, but had never seen them for more than a few seconds as a flash of green coming out of a tree. I took all these pictures from the table with my phone, not wanting to get up and startle them, but they stuck around for some 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I hadn’t seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Parrots_of_Telegraph_Hill">the documentary about them</a>, though I had long been meaning to. I made a point to watch it last night, and enjoyed it, and it is definitely weird.</p>
