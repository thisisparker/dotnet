Currently, people have access only to low-quality previews of the images; the United States Department of Agriculture, where the archive is held, should serve the public interest by making the entire collection of high quality scans free for all.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B-JuVUECUAAly4p.jpg" alt="B-JuVUECUAAly4p" /></p>

<p>The USDA’s National Agricultural Library hosts <a href="http://usdawatercolors.nal.usda.gov/pom/home.xhtml">the Pomological Watercolor Collection</a>, which contains images of different varieties of fruits and nuts, commissioned between 1886 and 1942.</p>

<p>They’re remarkable as art, and also have serious scientific importance: they are some of the only documentation, for example, of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/garden/apple-picking-season-is-here-dont-you-want-more-than-a-macintosh.html">thousands of apple types that no longer exist</a>. The USDA has <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2012/120806.htm">called the Pomological Watercolor Collection</a> “Perhaps the most attractive as well as historically important of NAL’s treasures,” and it was cited just this week in a <a href="http://cahnrs.wsu.edu/blog/2015/04/wsu-researchers-sleuth-resurrect-lost-apples-of-the-palouse/">Washington State University article about apple preservation efforts</a>.</p>

<p>The public should have access to these images, and that access should be automatic and unrestricted. Fortunately, that is technically possible: the USDA, through a grant from an environmental non-profit called <a href="http://cerestrust.org/the-ceres-trust/">The Ceres Trust</a>, went though a multi-year digitization effort and now has high-quality scans of every image. However, members of the public can currently only view low-resolution versions online, can only request up to three high-quality scans free of charge, and must pay $10 per file beyond that.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple.jpeg" alt="apple" /></p>

<p>And though the order page touts the fact that a <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/how-to-order">portion of proceeds will go to conservation efforts</a>, the numbers just don’t add up. I suspected that conservation costs are orders of magnitude higher than reproduction revenues, so I asked. <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/pomological-library-costs-and-revenues-16335/">Through a FOIA request to the USDA</a>, I obtained the digitization project report, as well as a breakdown of the last three and a half years of revenues that the collection has generated.</p>

<p>Digitizing the images cost $288,442. Since the collection went online in 2011, members of the public have ordered just 81 images, for a total of $565. That relatively tiny amount simply cannot justify the cost to the public of keeping these images behind a paywall.</p>

<p>There’s no question that these paintings, if made more available, could be creating value for the public. High quality images could be used in printed teaching materials, which can spur conservation efforts and spark agricultural research interests in students. They could illustrate relevant articles on Wikipedia, providing historical context from over a hundred years of agriculture. The high quality scans could be examined closely by independent researchers to turn up new information.</p>

<p>The collection could even expand if it is accessible enough, as the National Agricultural Library described in its own report: one researcher, on hearing about the digitization project, contributed seven contemporaneous paintings of blueberries that had been stored in his lab.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/almond.jpeg" alt="almond" /></p>

<p>Again, here’s the USDA’s own words on <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2012/120806.htm">the importance of public access</a> to the collection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With today’s growing interest in heirloom varieties and others that are no longer commonly grown, the collection is an invaluable storehouse of fruit knowledge and history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That knowledge is better served if the public has access to the scans, and it’s possible to do that today. If the cost of hosting and bandwidth is an issue, the Internet Archive and Wikimedia Commons would almost certainly be willing to host even the highest resolution scans.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="agriculture" /><category term="foia" /><category term="images" /><category term="paintings" /><category term="pomological watercolors" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="usda" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The federal government is sitting on 7,584 historical agricultural watercolor paintings that it should make freely available to the public today.

I didn’t quite hit all 28 days—here and there I’d go a little too long without getting to my computer—but I ended up with a collection of really cool things.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=from%3Axor%20%23pdtotd&amp;src=typd">shared them on Twitter with the hashtag #pdtotd</a>, which I imagined stood for “public domain thing of the day,” but I never explained what I was doing. My friend Zara took a look at it and guessed it actually stood for “public domain treasure of the day,” which seems like a better fit. Here are some of the things I shared.</p>

<h2 id="1-images-from-the-new-york-world-telegram--sun">1. Images from the New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun</h2>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B8y0hniCMAAwSz_.jpg" alt="B8y0hniCMAAwSz_" /></p>

<p>The NY W-T&amp;S dedicated a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:PD_New_York_World-Telegram_%26_Sun">collection of photos to the public domain</a>, including portraits of civil rights leaders like Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This seemed like an appropriate way to kick off Black History Month.</p>

<p>As I tweeted, the early 20th-century anti-Suffrage movement had “strong misandry game”. These <a href="http://bust.com/i-want-to-vote-but-my-wife-wont-let-me-check-out-these-vintage-suffragist-and-anti-suffrage-postcards.html">historical postcards</a> are interesting artifacts and freely available.</p>

Donaldson Lithographing Co.</a> was a hugely influential for turn-of-the-century copyright. Bleistein was an employee of a company that had designed circus posters for The Great Wallace Shows. Donaldson was a competitor of that company, and agreed to print a subsequent run of those same posters without authorization.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/800px-The_Great_Wallace_Shows_ballet_circus_poster.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At issue was whether these posters—which were certainly creative, but just as certainly commercial—could be restricted by copyright. By ruling in favor of the plaintiff, the Supreme Court made it clear that the bar for copyright eligibility is not some abstract notion of artistic merit, but simple originality. Commercial speech was just as qualified as fine art. From Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr’s <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=188&amp;page=239">majority opinion</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme, some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Manet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. Yet if they command the interest of any public, they have a commercial value — it would be bold to say that they have not an aesthetic and educational value — and the taste of any public is not to be treated with contempt. It is an ultimate fact for the moment, whatever may be our hopes for a change. That these pictures had their worth and their success is sufficiently shown by the desire to reproduce them without regard to the plaintiffs’ rights.</p>

<p>I’d read about this case many times, but had never seen high quality copies of the three posters at the heart of the matter. After a bit of digging, I found copies in the Library of Congress, which have been scanned at an extremely high resolution. I’ve cropped, cleaned up, and color-corrected the images in this post, but if you’ve got any interest I strongly recommend downloading the huge TIFF files from the LoC. Descriptions of each image by Holmes himself:</p>

<p>Nowadays it seems obvious that these creative and original images would be subject to copyright.
