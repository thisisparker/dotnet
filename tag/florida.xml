There’s no scandal here, but it’s fun to read about a city so smitten with their talented equestrian officers.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favorite missive comes from Kevin King in the Mayor’s Office, who writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wayne,</p>

  <p>The painting police horse is rivaling Dali in terms of popularity in St. Pete right now.</p>

  <p>Can your office work with Yolanda Fernandez in Police on harnessing this situation?</p>

  <p>FYI – the most recent request came from Larry Biddle w Arts Xchange who would like the horse for a fundraiser (I believe)….</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they’re pretty much all like that. Many more clips <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/jul/30/horse-artist-jacob/">over at Muckrock</a>.</p>

<p>One small note: alongside the Jacob request, I filed one on info about the trademark applications on <em>another</em> celebrity police horse in St. Petersburg—Amos the Wonder Horse—and <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/pinellas-county-10455/amos-the-wonder-horse-17313/">came up empty handed</a>. That’s a bit strange, considering the trademark <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86507083&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">was filed in January</a>—it was just published for review a month ago—but you’ve gotta pick your battles.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="florida" /><category term="foia" /><category term="horse" /><category term="muckrock" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Muckrock has written an article on Jacob, the painting police horse of St. Petersburg, Florida, based on documents I obtained through a public records request to the local police in April.
