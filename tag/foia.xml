  <p>The painting police horse is rivaling Dali in terms of popularity in St. Pete right now.</p>

  <p>Can your office work with Yolanda Fernandez in Police on harnessing this situation?</p>

But since I couldn’t find it online, <a href="http://records.oaklandnet.com/request/8927">I filed a request</a>, and got to interact for the first time with <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/recordtrac/">Oakland’s very cool RecordTrac system</a> for handling those requests. RecordTrac is a <a href="http://oaklandlocal.com/2013/10/oaktech-citys-new-recordtrac-app-launches-built-by-code-for-america-fellows/">Code For America fellowship project that launched a year and a half ago</a>, and it ensures <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/recordtrac_making_the_foia_process_less_terrible.php">the entire process is online and publicly available</a>, so users can see every request that gets filed and what response it received.</p>

<p>The value of that system becomes obvious pretty quickly after you start using it. For example, when I started looking through <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZTr-DlQ2IlEJFtZGpoEEv81BbyK8zscQzKGh0TL9szo/edit?usp=sharing">the compensation database</a>, one fact that jumped out immediately is that some Oakland police officers make significantly more than their base salary in payment for overtime work. In fact, the highest paid Oakland government employee in 2014 is a police officer who got some $165,000 in overtime pay. What could possibly be going on with overtime at OPD?</p>

<p>Searching through the public requests database turns up another person’s request, <a href="http://records.oaklandnet.com/request/7964">specifically covering OPD and overtime</a>. Those documents were released in the last few days and are immediately available to me and any other interested member of the public. That’s incredibly helpful to both me and the city. I get the records I’m looking for much faster, and can send follow-up requests without waiting for another round trip, and Oakland doesn’t have to process as many duplicates.</p>

<p>It also comes in handy where there are no responsive documents. Traditionally those requests don’t see a lot of publicity because, well, there are no documents to report on. But sometimes their absence is an interesting data point itself. Take, for example, <a href="http://records.oaklandnet.com/request/7946">this request for agreements</a> between the Oakland Public Library and law enforcement on disclosing patron information. It would be a much larger story if there were agreements like that, but it’s nice, too, to be able to refer to the request turning up no responsive documents. ((After I tweeted about this request, the Oakland Public Library reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/oaklibrary/status/593897888331083776">emphasize its opposition to that sort of agreement</a>.))</p>

<p>If all this seems familiar, it may be because services like <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/">Muckrock</a>, <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/xor/">where I’m a frequent user</a>, have implemented the same kind of thing on the requester end. Every request gets a permanent URL, where all associated documents are connected and made publicly available. Like RecordTrac, it keeps the status of requests updated, and notifies requesters when new information has come in.</p>

<p>Muckrock definitely makes the public records experience better, and has built an impressive collection of returned documents. But there’s an emergent property of the agencies themselves putting all that information online in the first place.</p>

<p>Oakland was lucky to pilot this program, and the avalanche of requests related to Occupy likely taught the city a lesson about handling them efficiently.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/postcode/recordtrac#recordtrac-">RecordTrac is already free software</a>, and as of about six months ago, the developers rolled the software into a <del><a href="http://blog.postcode.io/post/101138657517/welcome-to-nextrequest-the-open-public-records">hosted product called NextRequest</a></del>. <em>(UPDATE: the main RecordTrac developer <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/05/oaklands-awesome-public-records-request-system/#comment-464196">reached out to clarify</a> that NextRequest is not affiliated with the original team.

It can be <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-from-2015-05-05-004958.png">funny to see Muckrock joke</a> about how dated much of our country’s FOIA infrastructure is.

Currently, people have access only to low-quality previews of the images; the United States Department of Agriculture, where the archive is held, should serve the public interest by making the entire collection of high quality scans free for all.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B-JuVUECUAAly4p.jpg" alt="B-JuVUECUAAly4p" /></p>

<p>The USDA’s National Agricultural Library hosts <a href="http://usdawatercolors.nal.usda.gov/pom/home.xhtml">the Pomological Watercolor Collection</a>, which contains images of different varieties of fruits and nuts, commissioned between 1886 and 1942.</p>

<p>They’re remarkable as art, and also have serious scientific importance: they are some of the only documentation, for example, of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/garden/apple-picking-season-is-here-dont-you-want-more-than-a-macintosh.html">thousands of apple types that no longer exist</a>. The USDA has <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2012/120806.htm">called the Pomological Watercolor Collection</a> “Perhaps the most attractive as well as historically important of NAL’s treasures,” and it was cited just this week in a <a href="http://cahnrs.wsu.edu/blog/2015/04/wsu-researchers-sleuth-resurrect-lost-apples-of-the-palouse/">Washington State University article about apple preservation efforts</a>.</p>

<p>The public should have access to these images, and that access should be automatic and unrestricted. Fortunately, that is technically possible: the USDA, through a grant from an environmental non-profit called <a href="http://cerestrust.org/the-ceres-trust/">The Ceres Trust</a>, went though a multi-year digitization effort and now has high-quality scans of every image. However, members of the public can currently only view low-resolution versions online, can only request up to three high-quality scans free of charge, and must pay $10 per file beyond that.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apple.jpeg" alt="apple" /></p>

<p>And though the order page touts the fact that a <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/how-to-order">portion of proceeds will go to conservation efforts</a>, the numbers just don’t add up. I suspected that conservation costs are orders of magnitude higher than reproduction revenues, so I asked. <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/pomological-library-costs-and-revenues-16335/">Through a FOIA request to the USDA</a>, I obtained the digitization project report, as well as a breakdown of the last three and a half years of revenues that the collection has generated.</p>

<p>Digitizing the images cost $288,442. Since the collection went online in 2011, members of the public have ordered just 81 images, for a total of $565. That relatively tiny amount simply cannot justify the cost to the public of keeping these images behind a paywall.</p>

<p>There’s no question that these paintings, if made more available, could be creating value for the public. High quality images could be used in printed teaching materials, which can spur conservation efforts and spark agricultural research interests in students. They could illustrate relevant articles on Wikipedia, providing historical context from over a hundred years of agriculture. The high quality scans could be examined closely by independent researchers to turn up new information.</p>

<p>The collection could even expand if it is accessible enough, as the National Agricultural Library described in its own report: one researcher, on hearing about the digitization project, contributed seven contemporaneous paintings of blueberries that had been stored in his lab.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/almond.jpeg" alt="almond" /></p>

<p>Again, here’s the USDA’s own words on <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2012/120806.htm">the importance of public access</a> to the collection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With today’s growing interest in heirloom varieties and others that are no longer commonly grown, the collection is an invaluable storehouse of fruit knowledge and history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That knowledge is better served if the public has access to the scans, and it’s possible to do that today. If the cost of hosting and bandwidth is an issue, the Internet Archive and Wikimedia Commons would almost certainly be willing to host even the highest resolution scans.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="agriculture" /><category term="foia" /><category term="images" /><category term="paintings" /><category term="pomological watercolors" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="usda" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The federal government is sitting on 7,584 historical agricultural watercolor paintings that it should make freely available to the public today.

Markey, that appears at official events. The character is an anthropomorphized registered trademark circled-R symbol, and is weird and creepy and I wanted to know more.

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/B33-diQCEAAiLX-.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This last week, USPTO delivered the goods, with a little more than a hundred pages of emails and internal documents about the character’s development. Not much scandal afoot, but there are plenty of bizarre shots of T. Markey in various seasonal situations from an internal calendar, and a lot of enthusiasm from various USPTO folks about how good the character looks in a varsity jacket or a baseball glove.</p>

<p>There are also lots of redactions. Many appear redacting the results of a trademark search for the phrases “Marky” and “Markey,” which are presumably public records.

((The US government’s fiscal calendar runs October to October, so FY2014 has been over for a month.)) Looking through these logs is interesting because you can start to pick out a little narrative for many of the requests, and you can get a sense of the public’s connection with an agency. The USPTO’s log is manageable, too: they only handle about 250-300 FOIA requests per year, and in my experience have been very timely with replies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/foia-log-2014-13686/#1350531-responsive-documents">full PDF from the USPTO</a>—and <a href="http://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/files_static/uspto-fy2014-foia-log.csv">my cleaned up CSV of the data</a>—are available from Muckrock. I’ve gone through and picked out some of the things that struck me as interesting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The request that took the longest to fulfill was <a href="http://patentlyo.com/author/dennis-crouch">Dennis Crouch’s (of Patently O)</a> for “Nomination documents for Michelle Lee as Deputy Directorof the USPTO; documents discussing whether the Michelle Lee’s nomination process was proper and/or followed the law.” It took 98 days.</li>
  <li>At least 8 of the 256 requests were about the Washington football team whose trademark has recently been challenged. They requests variously wanted communications with the public, with Congress, and with the relevant trademark judges.</li>
  <li>One Josef Viel requested in March a “list of all the retailers that sell disposable underwear.” In September—six months later—he was back, looking for a “list of manufacturers that produce disposable underwear and retailers that sell them.”</li>
  <li>Two requests close to my heart asked for information about a trademark by Banksy and USPTO documents on The Pirate Bay. I’ve reached out to those filers to see if they got anything interesting. (Note: the Banksy request has to do with an interesting trademark situation related to the registration of names or pseudonyms; EverythingTrademarks has a <a href="http://everythingtrademarks.com/2013/12/07/banksy/">really great write-up of what’s going on</a>.)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.keionline.org/">Knowledge Ecology International</a> and <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a> each appeared: KEI was looking for information about VP Biden’s communications with the government of India about the cancer drug Herceptin, and PK wanted a <a href="http://patentlyo.com/lawjournal/2014/11/uspto-on-101.html">list of patent applications that were withdrawn</a> from allowance as a result of <em>Alice v. CLS Bank</em>.</li>
  <li>A couple of secrecy related things, pertaining to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_Secrecy_Act">Invention Secrecy Act</a> that creates sort of a parallel classified patent system. <a href="http://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/">Steven Aftergood</a> requested a <a href="http://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/10/invention-secrecy-2013/">copy of the latest Secrecy Review Activity Report</a>; Jonathan Byrne has two separate requests for info about the Invention Secrecy Act (which might be the result of a defective first request) and then a follow up specifically about this previously classified patent for a <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US6728328">safety control circuit for a neutronic reactor</a>; and <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonLeopold">Jason Leopold</a> requested a list of rescinded secrecy orders.</li>

((The US government’s fiscal calendar runs October to October, so FY2014 has been over for a month.)) Looking through these logs is interesting because you can start to pick out a little narrative for many of the requests, and you can get a sense of the public’s connection with an agency. The USPTO’s log is manageable, too: they only handle about 250-300 FOIA requests per year, and in my experience have been very timely with replies.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Requesting Lou Reed’s FBI file</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/dotnet/2013/10/requesting-lou-reeds-fbi-file/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Requesting Lou Reed’s FBI file" /><published>2013-10-28T02:52:23-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-28T02:52:23-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/dotnet/2013/10/requesting-lou-reeds-fbi-file</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/dotnet/2013/10/requesting-lou-reeds-fbi-file/"><![CDATA[<p>Lou Reed died today at 71. His music — especially the the four Velvet Underground records — have always been very important to me. (If you must know, not actually <em>always</em>, but starting from the time Liza at Camp Half Moon loaned me <em>Loaded</em> and I listened to it over and over on my Discman.)</p>

<p>When a person dies, the privacy exemptions to the FOIA [(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C)] no longer apply. That means a federal agency like the FBI can produce records that might not have previously been available. Using Muckrock, <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/lou-reed-fbi-file-8671/">I’ve requested Lou Reed’s FBI file</a>, which must be filled in 4 weeks but may actually come sooner. When <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/russell-tyrone-jones-ol-dirty-bastard-963/">Rich Jones requested Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s FBI file</a>, that came in a week (and just days before Christmas, too).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> on November 1 I got a response from the FBI saying there were no responsive documents. I find that hard to believe, but have no choice… unless I want to start rumors that they were withheld according to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552#c">5 USC §552(c)</a> because he was an informant or involved in ongoing crimes or something. Barring that—case closed.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="foia" /><category term="lou reed" /><category term="muckrock" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lou Reed died today at 71.
