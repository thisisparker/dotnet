<p>(When <a href="http://boingboing.net/2006/02/21/copyright-office-hea.html">BoingBoing linked to the video</a> in February of 2006, YouTube was in its first year of existence, and far from the ubiquity it’s since achieved. Instead, the post points to AVI, MP4, and MPG files [formerly] hosted on <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/">iBiblio</a>.)</p>

<p>I was able to dig up a version crawled by the Internet Archive, and have <a href="http://archive.org/details/MarybethPetersFormerUsRegisterOfCopyrightsOnTermsBeingTooLong">posted the video more prominently</a> on that site.</p>
