So far as I could tell, none of these had been digitized yet, so that’s kind of exciting. Here’s a picture of me at work, taken by <a href="https://twitter.com/maira">Maira</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, the scanner is really great, and a work in progress, so for now all it does is dump the photographs—high res images taken by DSLRs affixed to the machine—as sequentially numbered JPEGs in a directory on an attached computer. For a 600 page book, that’s over a gigabyte of photos, and not terribly useful as a digitized book.</p>

<p>So I used <a href="http://scantailor.sourceforge.net/">ScanTailor</a>, which is a great piece of free software, to take a page that looked like the one on the left and (basically running on autopilot) output one like that on the right.</p>

<p>But then I had a directory full of TIFFs, which looked great but were not as portable as a PDF or OCRed to be treated like text. With a little help from smart people like <a href="https://twitter.com/konklone">Eric</a> and <a href="http://loyalty.org/~schoen/">Seth</a>, I was able to write a script to loop through that directory and output a big PDF, and another to run the images through <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract</a> and output an OCRed text file.</p>

<p>These are really really simple scripts (which is good because I’ve got no idea what I’m doing), but in case those are useful to anybody I’ve <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/bookscanning">put them up on GitHub</a> (and even released those three-line loops into the public domain, ha.)</p>

<p>The next step, I think, is manual proofreading. Unfortunately, I don’t think that can be scripted.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="books" /><category term="bookscanning" /><category term="e-books" /><category term="noisebridge" /><category term="programming" /><category term="scanning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had the pleasure of using Noisebridge’s book scanner to “rip” a couple of rare or unusual books I had lying around.
