Not much to see—it’s just a house in a residential neighborhood—but we were nearby and thought it’d be fun to make the trip. Here’s a picture of the five of us posed out in front (from left to right, that’s me, Sarah Jeong, Marcia Hofmann, Kashmir Hill, and Trevor Timm).</p>

<p>We hatched an idea to come back with sidewalk chalk, and on the day I left for the airport we stopped by and I took to the street. Here are the results.</p>

It was really a remarkable experience, and we were lucky enough to get it covered by a pretty wide range of media. Here’s a small sample:</p>

<p>The airship itself looked pretty incredible. <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/diverse-groups-fly-airship-over-nsas-utah-data-center-protest-illegal-internet-spying">EFF has more photos taken from the helicopter</a>, but here’s one, credit to Greenpeace:</p>

<p>I also got some photos from in the airship itself. The obligatory selfie with me and Sim, the pilot for Greenpeace:</p>

<p>And of course some of the data center itself (here in the background):</p>

This one’s about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Rogers">Michael S. Rogers</a>, Navy Vice Admiral and presumptive nominee for Director of the NSA and head of the U.S. Cyber Command. These two jobs are the one being vacated by General Keith Alexander after he retires in mid-March, and obviously it’ll be kind of a crazy time to be taking over the NSA.</p>

<p>I thought a long time ago that it would be harder and harder to create new Wikipedia articles as most everything is covered by the million-plus pages on the site. But of course, the list of notable things will never stop growing right alongside.</p>

<p>It seemed especially important that Michael S. Rogers have a page now, because he’s likely to be in the news a lot more if he actually does get the nomination, and it’s perilously easy to confuse him with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Michigan_politician)">Michigan Representative Mike Rogers</a>, Chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. ((And there’s actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D._Rogers">a second Representative Mike Rogers</a> in the House from Alabama.)) These two men have a lot of overlap in their jobs, it’ll be interesting to see how the national security community decides to disambiguate them.</p>

<p>It’s also nice that there’s a public domain photograph of the guy from his Navy bio. That made the page come together and look like a real encyclopedia article quickly. I’d forgotten the feeling I get when I first make an article—I keep hoping somebody else will come along and edit and add and flesh the thing out. I guess that will happen pretty quickly if he gets nominated and confirmed.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="michael s rogers" /><category term="nsa" /><category term="wikipedia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first time in a long time I have started a new article on the Wikipedia.
