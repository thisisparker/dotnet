<p>Here’s a <a href="https://archive.org/details/musopen-chopin">public domain recording of Chopin’s “Anhang,”</a> funded by the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/set-chopin-free/description">Musopen Kickstarter campaign</a> to release free recordings of his entire oeuvre, slowed down by a factor of eight with <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/paulstretch.html">Audacity’s paulstretch plugin</a>.</p>

<p>When I went to upload it, I wanted a cool cover graphic. I took one of the only known photos of Chopin, and glitched it manually with a hex editor, entering new values, copying and pasting, and deleting things sort of at random. This was my first time glitching an image like that, and I relied heavily on tutorials from <a href="http://www.docpop.org/2014/01/a-glitch-primer-editing-image-files-with-text-editors/">Doc Pop</a> and <a href="http://www.certainly-strange.com/?p=548">Steen</a> for how to do it. I couldn’t really get anything to work with a PNG, but once I converted to JPG I was able to get something like this.</p>
