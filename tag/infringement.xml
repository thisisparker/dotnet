To summarize: Carr is shocked to see that the very same tech community who rallied against SOPA and PIPA is now rallying behind 37 Signals in <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/28/cant-look-away/">a case involving blatant design plagiarism</a> — down to hotlinked images — by another start-up named Curebit.</p>

<p>Clear thinkers have long complained about the hit job the content lobby have done on the language of copyright but rarely has the point been so clearly made that a muddled use of language translates into unclear and outright incorrect arguments. Carr’s accusations of hypocrisy by the tech community in this situation rest on two blatantly false premises. For one, Carr doesn’t know the difference between “infringement”, “theft”, and “plagiarism”. To quote the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it, as some argued on Twitter when I asked the question earlier, that plagiarism is different from copyright theft? No. And not least because plagiarism is copyright theft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would comfort me to know Carr is trolling here, but I’m afraid he isn’t. If you’ve ever been curious about why it’s important to use the correct words in this area, you’ve got a grade A example in Paul Carr. Let’s break it down: plagiarism is wrongful appropriation, and is not a crime. An act of plagiarism <em>can</em> also be copyright infringement, but an act of urination <em>can</em> also be public indecency, and you’d do well to know the difference. As for what “copyright theft” is here? Completely irrelevant to the case, and serves as a clunky malaprop throughout the entire piece. And just to get it out of the way, is copyright infringement theft? <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-infringement-and-theft-%E2%80%93-the-difference-110827/">No</a>, <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/11/copyright-infringement-vs-theft.html">no</a>, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100913/22513210998.shtml">no</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html">no</a>.</p>

<p>Second, instead of examining the premise that “the tech community doesn’t care about authorship” and determining it’s a straw man lobbying tactic, Carr swallows the point hook-line-and-sinker and uses it as evidence that they’re behaving hypocritically.</p>

<p>Think about it: Doesn’t this reaction serve as pretty good evidence that members of this community — many of whom produce creative content all day at their jobs — really do care about authorship? That maybe the MPAA spokespeople were wrong, and the tech community’s arguments against SOPA and PIPA as major <a href="http://ammori.org/2011/12/08/controversial-copyright-bills-would-violate-first-amendment-letters-to-congress-by-laurence-tribe-and-me/">unconstitutional</a> free speech violations that would <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/internet-inventors-warn-against-sopa-and-pipa">undermine Internet infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/proposed-copyright-bill-threatens-whistleblowing-and-human-rights">human rights efforts</a> around the world were more than just a fig leaf for the “I like free stuff”?</p>

<p>A gross conflation of terms gets you to the point where you don’t realize that both Hollywood’s complaints and their reactions look very, very different from 37 Signals’. Hollywood’s big problem is with freeloaders, unless I missed something big and they wanted to shut down these rogue sites for their roles in helping distribute scripts for shot-by-shot remakes of blockbuster films. And they’ve chosen to address that concern not by complaining on Twitter, but by pushing for backroom legislation so obviously and outrageously opposed to the public interest that the reaction from the Internet scared the otherwise lobbyist-cowed legislators into retreat.</p>

<p>It’s not like the MPAA studios haven’t tried to just appeal to social norms as a way to stop unauthorized copying, but their messages — “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU">You wouldn’t steal a car</a>” — suffer from the same lack of understanding and contempt for their users that Carr’s piece displays.</p>

<p>It seems simple to me that Carr thought this latest event was noteworthy because he doesn’t understand the issues, so every new twist and turn is unexpected. This distinction between infringement and theft everybody keeps talking about? Don’t worry, it probably doesn’t matter. The tech community’s actual articulate position? Nah, just take the MPAA’s word for what they’re saying.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="infringement" /><category term="paul carr" /><category term="plagiarism" /><category term="response" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is so much aggressively wrong with Paul Carr’s recent “Angry Nerds” piece that it is hard to know where to begin.

(I’m giving the whole subtitle so that it’s clear what kind of book this was, but I’m not really writing about the book here.)</p>

<p>Because of the title, I had hoped that the book would spend some time addressing the common conflation of copyright <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Free_rider_problem">free riding</a> with other kinds of infringement. One element of that conflation is combining “creative-” and “consumptive infringement”; those terms were coined in <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1399522">a paper by Christopher Jon Sprigman</a>, and actually do appear on a single page of Levine’s book, with a reference to the excellent <a href="http://www.copyhype.com/2010/09/creative-vs-consumptive-infringement">Copyhype post on the topic</a>.</p>

<p>(Side note: I’m talking specifically about “infringement” in this post, but a similar phenomenon exists around the word “piracy”. William Patry is among those who have railed on the use of that word to mean anything other than “<a href="http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2008/05/anti-piracy-scam-canada-insulted-again.html">the massive, commercial, unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted works</a>“, but Adrian Johns, in his dense but enjoyable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Piracy-Intellectual-Property-Gutenberg-Gates/dp/0226401189">history of piracy</a>, points to the “free rider” definition of the word being used in the UK as early as the 1920s, to describe people who didn’t pay their <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom_%28historical%29">broadcast receiving license fees</a>. In any case, the general problem of <a href="http://freeculture.org/blog/2011/07/21/swartz-jstor/">imprecise usage of words that describe concepts related to the internet</a> is pretty widespread.)</p>

<p>Splitting up infringement into creative and consumptive varieties is useful, but doesn’t go far enough. Any book with the ambitious scope of “Free Ride” needs to acknowledge that there are at least a handful of different behavioral patterns that include “infringement” in some form, but which have completely distinct motivations and explanations. I propose the following list of four. It’s not totally exhaustive, but to my mind is a good start.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free riders</strong> represent most “leeching” users of a peer-to-peer network, or downloaders on the big file-hosting sites. These are the individuals that the RIAA and the MPAA have spent the years after the Napster and Grokster cases suing. The four different types of “piracy” that Lawrence Lessig describes in <a href="http://www.sslug.dk/~chlor/lessig/freeculture/piracy.html">chapter 5 of Free Culture</a> are performed mostly by people in this group.</li>
  <li><strong>Commercial pirates</strong> engage in behavior that is pretty widely rejected, and are often the rhetorical target of media groups, and the reason for penalties that are overly harsh and ridiculous when applied outside of this group. Theater “camming” laws were aimed at commercial pirates, but <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/01/AR2007080102398.html">caught 19-year-old Jhannet Sejas</a>. The <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/DeCSS#Legal_response">DeCSS trial in Norway</a> was purported to be about commercial piracy, but concerned decryption technology that isn’t required for commercial duplication.</li>
  <li><strong>The Scene</strong> is one of the more enigmatic groups, and I’ll admit that their motivation is far less straightforward than “getting free music” or “making money”. Members of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Warez_scene">the Scene</a> (or the Warez Scene) belong to different groups that compete to release popular content as quickly and in as high quality as possible. These same kinds of individuals spend long hours and sometimes serious money creating complete databases of content and coding private trackers, and often describe their work as being driven by a commitment to free speech or to sharing art.</li>
  <li><strong>Remix culture</strong> is the only strictly “creative infringement” category on this list. Individuals making transformative uses of copyrighted works have stayed out of the media companies legal sights, for the most part, but artists like <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Girl_Talk_%28musician%29">Girl Talk</a> have still become the poster children for this kind of “illegal art”. The occasional lawsuits around these uses have carried potential damages that, driven up by laws targeting commercial pirates, are so ruinously high that it can <a href="http://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/">make sense to settle even if you believe you’re in the legal clear</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I’ve said, this list isn’t exhaustive, but I hope that I’ve demonstrated why it’s necessary, say, to draw a distinction between the penalties assigned to commercial pirates and free riders, or to consider the motivations of remixers separately from those of The Scene. If you have or want more information about these categories, sound off in the comments.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="infringement" /><category term="mash-ups" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently finished reading the new book by Robert Levine, called Free Ride: How the Internet is Destroying the Culture Business and How the Culture Business can Fight Back.
