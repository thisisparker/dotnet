And though public editor Margaret Sullivan claims to have sifted through though thousands of comments, my one little nitpick hasn’t been addressed.</p>

<p>For years the Times has had <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/">a hidden feature called “Emphasis,”</a> which would allow readers to click shift twice and then highlight and deeplink to individual sentences and paragraphs. It’s really great for a site like the New York Times to be able to pick out one well-reported detail in a longer piece and direct people’s attention directly there.</p>

<p>I liked it so much I found a WordPress plugin that incorporates the feature and <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/11/new-plugin-wp-emphasis/">added it to this blog</a>. I am skeptical that anybody has ever used it here, but it’s been an option. (You can try it out by clicking shift twice.)</p>

<p>In any case, Emphasis is gone from the new redesign, and as far as I can tell hasn’t been mentioned since. <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/the-technology-behind-the-nytimes-com-redesign/">The technical recap</a> describes a ground-up rewrite, and it probably was just not a priority. I suspect it was never a very popular feature, but I, for one, miss it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="emphasis" /><category term="new york times" /><category term="web design" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times launched a major redesign last month and, as is the way with these things, got a bunch of angry comments from pitchfork-wielding Times readers who wanted to be able to print articles with a single click instead of two.
