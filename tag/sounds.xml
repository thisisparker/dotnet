I didn’t quite hit all 28 days—here and there I’d go a little too long without getting to my computer—but I ended up with a collection of really cool things.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=from%3Axor%20%23pdtotd&amp;src=typd">shared them on Twitter with the hashtag #pdtotd</a>, which I imagined stood for “public domain thing of the day,” but I never explained what I was doing. My friend Zara took a look at it and guessed it actually stood for “public domain treasure of the day,” which seems like a better fit. Here are some of the things I shared.</p>

<h2 id="1-images-from-the-new-york-world-telegram--sun">1. Images from the New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun</h2>

<p>The NY W-T&amp;S dedicated a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:PD_New_York_World-Telegram_%26_Sun">collection of photos to the public domain</a>, including portraits of civil rights leaders like Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This seemed like an appropriate way to kick off Black History Month.</p>

<p>As I tweeted, the early 20th-century anti-Suffrage movement had “strong misandry game”. These <a href="http://bust.com/i-want-to-vote-but-my-wife-wont-let-me-check-out-these-vintage-suffragist-and-anti-suffrage-postcards.html">historical postcards</a> are interesting artifacts and freely available.</p>

<p>This is probably the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Fantasmagori">first ever animated film</a>, and it’s delightfully silly and strange. It wouldn’t take much to make this feel very modern and new.</p>

There have been a few efforts to document sound destinations, including <a href="http://www.sonicwonders.org/">the wonderful Sound Tourism</a>, but nothing that feels comprehensive.</p>

<p>There are at least a few kinds of sonic tourism spots, and some of the impressive ones weren’t conceived of as destinations at all. Teufelsberg in Berlin, for example, is a giant echo chamber. Common sounds take on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/richarddevine/field-recordings-from">an otherworldly quality as they bounce off the walls</a>. I’d love to visit <a href="http://www.mndaily.com/2012/05/01/quietest-room-earth">the world’s quietest anechoic chamber at Orfield Labs</a> in Minnesota. And otherwise impressive sights, like the regular movements of enormous bat colonies in Austin, are really <a href="http://soundcloud.com/binauralairwaves/bats-in-austin-texas-under-congress-st-bridge">incredible for the sound they produce</a>.</p>

<p>In San Francisco, though, there are a few places especially geared towards listeners. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ">Wave Organ</a>, an acoustic sculpture by the Exploratorium on the bay, is one such location. It’s a beautiful little stone structure out on the jetty with a network of Seussian pipes running from under the waves up to various listening stations. The rumbles and gurgles of the incoming tides are amplified and distorted as they get routed up to the listeners. I made this recording during a visit:</p>

<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" loading="lazy" scrolling="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F45543677&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=007FFF" width="100%"></iframe>

<p>Another spot in the Bay Area is the <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/aristides-demetrios-wind-harp">92-foot-tall aeolian harp in South San Francisco</a>. Aeolian harps are passive instruments played by the movement of the wind, and this one’s on a hill with a great view of the Bay. I haven’t yet been, but I’m looking forward to it. Is there another city in the world that has two major acoustic sculptures like these?</p>

<p>Add to that that San Francisco is the home of <a href="http://www.audium.org/">Audium</a>, the world’s only “theater of sound-sculptured space,” and San Francisco seems like a global leader for sonic tourism. I’d be interested in finding more spots to visit, here and elsewhere.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="aeolian harp" /><category term="audium" /><category term="san francisco" /><category term="sonic tourism" /><category term="sounds" /><category term="wave organ" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m really intrigued by the idea of sonic tourism — going to places to experience the acoustic landscape there.

((It’s sometimes attributed to Miles Davis, but who knows.))</p>

<p>This American Life did an impressive thing with their most recent episode, <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction">Retraction</a>, which was entirely dedicated to retracting <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/454/mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory">an earlier episode about Apple and their Chinese production facilities</a>.</p>

<p>Not only did they make an extremely compelling hour of radio about something that is really an internal affair, but they were also unusually symmetrical in their retraction; that is, they’ve given it as much space and prominence as the original story, which is admirable.</p>

<p>One aspect that makes the episode so interesting is the amount of silence they’ve left in the interview. When lies come to light, it’s an uncomfortable experience for everybody involved. This American Life did a great job of capturing that discomfort, and left more awkward silence than I’ve ever heard on a radio show. To get back to that jazz saying, it was the words they weren’t saying, the rests and pauses, that really told the story.</p>

<p>In that spirit, I’ve made a supercut of some of the longest expanses of silence on the show. I recommend listening to the full program. If you’ve already done that, you may find this interesting.</p>

As a ukulele enthusiast, it was a real blast: Kamakas are some of the best in the world and have been the weapon of choice for, among others, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSkP3uym5k">Jake Shimabukuro</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5CkIniOcqs">George Harrison</a>. Even better than the factory and showroom, though, was getting a chance to hear Fred Kamaka tell all kinds of stories about growing up making ukes.</p>

<p>Fred is now 86, and he has been working for the company alongside his older brother Samuel Jr. since about 1930, when he was 5 years old. (On the tour, Fred shows a picture from that era featuring him at 5, working in a store full of ukuleles selling for $5.) It was common practice then, in Hawaii and throughout the country, that sons were workers. Before they started in school, they’d be expected to work all day for their fathers. Fred says he and his brother Samuel considered themselves lucky not to be the sons of bakers, who’d have to be up at 4 each morning to start baking!</p>

<p>Samuel Kamaka Sr., by his son’s description, was an exacting craftsman and didn’t accept cut corners. When the young Fred would make a mistake in the workshop, the botched ukulele would always be called “junk”, and would be thrown out. Fred describes hearing his father use that word “junk” throughout his life — from his deathbed, Samuel Kamaka Sr. insisted that his sons never use the family name on any junk.</p>

<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" loading="lazy" scrolling="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18630260&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=540&amp;maxheight=810&amp;in=thisisparker%2Fsets%2Ffred-kamaka-ukulele-tour" width="540"></iframe>

<p>Before that meeting, Fred and his brother had served in the military in World War II and were entitled to attend college on the G.I. Bill. They each decided to do that, much to their father’s disappointment: he was counting on them as workers! He cut them off, and they found themselves living on a $25/month allotment from the government, until they found another way to pull in some money.</p>

<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" loading="lazy" scrolling="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18630259&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=540&amp;maxheight=810&amp;in=thisisparker%2Fsets%2Ffred-kamaka-ukulele-tour" width="540"></iframe>

<p>Kamaka Ukulele continues to be a family business, but Fred and Samuel Jr.’s sons weren’t required to work in the factory growing up. Nevertheless, as ukulele playing became more popular among their friends, they found themselves attracted to the family business:</p>

<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" loading="lazy" scrolling="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F18630261&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=540&amp;maxheight=810&amp;in=thisisparker%2Fsets%2Ffred-kamaka-ukulele-tour" width="540"></iframe>

<p>That generation is now grown, and have children of their own. All told, there are eight children in the next generation of Kamakas, the great-grandchildren of Samuel Kamaka Sr. Fred’s hoping at least four of them will come to work for the family business, now coming up on its 100th anniversary.</p>

<p>The Kamaka factory is a relatively small place, occupying two floors of a medium-sized building for the showroom, office, storage, and factory space. They sell instruments as quickly as they can make them, and new orders take about a month to fulfill. Each ukulele is made of the beautiful and uniquely Hawaiian koa wood, which can only legally be harvested from naturally fallen trees and is accordingly expensive.</p>

<p>Altogether, the Kamaka factory tour is a great one, and I recommend it highly. It’s so great to get to meet guys like Fred Kamaka, who are really living history. He runs the tour just about <a href="http://www.kamakahawaii.com/contact.html">every Tuesday-Friday at 10:30 am</a> — so if you find yourself around Honolulu then, go! Note that they don’t normally sell ukes from the showroom, and don’t sell factory seconds at all. I happened to luck out, and they had a couple for sale on orders that had dropped out, so my father and I each picked up an <a href="http://www.kamakahawaii.com/instruments.html#ukehf2">HF-2</a>. I’ll be writing more about that soon…</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="kamaka" /><category term="pictures" /><category term="sounds" /><category term="ukulele" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Tuesday, I had the chance to take a tour of the Kamaka ukulele factory guided by Fred Kamaka Sr., whose father Samuel Kamaka founded the company in 1916. As a ukulele enthusiast, it was a real blast: Kamakas are some of the best in the world and have been the weapon of choice for, among others, Jake Shimabukuro and George Harrison. Even better than the factory and showroom, though, was getting a chance to hear Fred Kamaka tell all kinds of stories about growing up making ukes.]]></summary></entry></feed>
