In that time it archived somewhere around 7.2 million links total from about 9,000 users.((“Quote tweets” are treated like links to tweets, and constituted about a third of the total links. Something like 4.8 million links backed up were at domains other than Twitter.)) The last link it archived was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-data-throttling-20180822-story.html">this LA Times story about Verizon throttling California firefighters</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/elizs/status/1032644299144527872">tweeted on Thursday morning</a>.</p>

<p>LinkArchiver stopped working this week when <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/details-and-what-to-expect-from-the-api-deprecations-this-week-on-august-16-2018/110746">Twitter turned off the User Stream API</a> that it relied on. Under the hood, LinkArchiver was only looking at its timeline, so it could use Twitter’s built-in following features to make its user list. Since that API change, it can’t pull down a “stream” of its timeline, and so would have to be redesigned to continue to work.</p>

<p>Even as this project is shutting down, I consider it a pretty major success. I am very grateful to Jacob Hoffman-Andrews for <a href="https://twitter.com/j4cob/status/883054720260087808">pitching me the underlying idea</a>. Writing <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/linkarchiver/">the code</a> (and seeing it get an enthusiastic reception) was a great way to kick off my time at Recurse Center last summer. I’m also grateful to Ben Cotton who gave it a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/7/linkarchiver-automatically-submits-links-internet-archive">nice write-up at opensource.com</a> when it launched.</p>

<p>I’ve had a few people ask me about archiving and backup options now that this is no longer available. I’m considering doing something similar for Mastodon, or for plain RSS feeds, but I also don’t want to downplay the fact that Internet Archive does a very good job of running the Wayback Machine crawler, and so the main value I can add is adding a personal layer. In any future work on things like LinkArchiver, I’d want to keep track of that.</p>

<p>There’s also a way to do a Twitter redesign with existing APIs, probably. Instead of getting a stream from Twitter that pinged on new tweet events, it could request new tweets at regular intervals, using an API that’s still operational. If somebody wants to write that, they’re welcome to, but <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/twitters-new-developer-guidelines-might-end-fun-bot-accounts.html">given the way Twitter is</a>, I’m not eager to do so.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bots" /><category term="programming" /><category term="twitter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a little over a year of service, @LinkArchiver, the Twitter bot that automatically made Internet Archive backups of the links you tweeted, has archived its last link.

Ideally I would find something free and reliable that didn’t require me to agree to many developer terms or sign up for an API token. Google <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/google-weather-api/2012/08/28">shuttered its undocumented Weather API</a> in 2012, and Yahoo’s offering, which has changed a few times over the years, now requires an account and a consumer key and secret.</p>

<p>It took some poking around but I was eventually successful, and now @choochoobot should correctly show clouds, rain, snow, or thunderstorms, depending on whether observations in New York at the moment it’s tweeting.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screenshot_2017-09-22_15-46-34.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Current observed weather conditions seems to me like something that should be provided by the government as open data. Fortunately, that intuition was correct: free realtime weather data is openly available, if you know where to look.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service, an agency within NOAA, provides weather observations from stations all over the US in RSS and parseable XML formats. And while parsing XML in Python isn’t exactly pleasant, it’s straightforward enough and I am now able to get qualitative descriptions of the current weather that I can translate into emoji. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/choochoobot/blob/master/choochoogen.py#L62-L86">the relevant code</a>, and here’s how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each time @choochoobot tweets, it checks to see whether it’s daytime or nighttime. If it’s nighttime, I skip the weather check and instead calculate the phase and placement of the moon in the sky.</li>
  <li>If it’s during the day, I make download the <a href="http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KNYC.xml">XML file provided by the KNYC weather station</a> in Central Park. You can load the same file in your browser at any point, but you probably have to view-source to see it in a reasonable human-readable format. That’s one of about <a href="http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/">1,800 locations in US states and territories</a> that the NWS provides information for.</li>
  <li><span class="citation">@choochoobot</span> then parses the XML file using Python’s built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">ElementTree XML API</a>. The relevant field for my purposes is labeled “weather”, which contains a text description of the observed conditions.</li>
  <li>At least in theory, that phrase will always be one of the 250 or so pre-set descriptions <a href="http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/weather.php">provided by the the NWS</a>. These are sort of grouped into categories—there’s a pretty clear thunderstorm grouping, and one for hail—but it seems a bit ad hoc. My use requires classifying the observed weather into just four or five buckets with matching emoji; I just made a big list of terms that I’d take to mean “cloudy,” for example, and checked to see whether the observed weather phrase was on that list.</li>
  <li>Then I pick emoji for the sky, and put the whole tweet together. If the weather is cloudy, I replace the sun emoji with a sun-behind-clouds emoji. Real scientific stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case it’s useful, I’ve converted the NWS list of <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/pull/278">weather conditions to JSON</a> and submitted it to Darius Kazemi’s corpora project. Once that gets merged in, those weather conditions will all be available that way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bots" /><category term="howto" /><category term="programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="twitter" /><category term="weather" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I decided to add realtime weather effects to @choochoobot, I knew there were a few qualities I wanted to find in a data source.

The great thing about a catalog that large is that, if you know what you want, you’re likely to find it. On the other hand, if you just want to browse it can be overwhelming and even intimidating. Each item could possibly be a delight, but it’s difficult to even think about individual records in the face of such a huge archive.</p>

<p>In that sense, would-be browsers face similar challenges with the Great 78 Project as they do with the <a href="https://usdawatercolors.nal.usda.gov/pom/home.xhtml">Pomological Watercolor Collection</a>—an archive <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/tag/pomological-watercolors/">I’ve worked with a lot</a>. Sensing that similarity, I decided to build a tool like <a href="https://twitter.com/pomological">@pomological</a> to help surface individual records.</p>

<p><span class="citation"><a href="https://twitter.com/78_sampler">@78_sampler</a> tweets every two hours with a randomly selected record from the Archive’s collection. It was important to me that the audio fit smoothly and natively into a Twitter timeline, so I decided to render each tune into a video file using the Archive’s still image of the record as the visual. Twitter limits videos to 2:20—exactly 140 seconds, cute—which is shorter than most 78 tunes, so while rendering the video I truncate the clip at that point with a short audio fade at the end.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/78_sampler">code to do all this</a> is a short Python script which I’ve posted online. It relies on ffmpeg to do the video encoding. Crafting ffmpeg commands is famously convoluted, and it’s a little frustrating to format those commands to be called from Python. Maybe that’s something I’ll do differently in the future but, for now, this works and I can dip my cup into the deep Archive well with a little more ease than before.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bots" /><category term="internet archive" /><category term="music" /><category term="programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="twitter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Internet Archive hosts an incredible collection of over 25,000 professionally digitized 78rpm records.

<p>The idea for <span class="citation">@LinkArchiver</span> was <a href="https://twitter.com/j4cob/status/883054720260087808">suggested by my friend Jacob</a>. I liked it because it was useful, relatively simple, and combined things I knew (Python wrappers for the Twitter API) with things I didn’t (event-based programming, making a process run constantly in the background, and more). I did not expect it to get as enthusiastic a reaction as it has, but that’s also nice.</p>

<p>The entire bot is <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/linkarchiver/">one short Python script</a> that uses the Twython library to listen to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/userstreams">Twitter User stream API</a>. This is the first of my Twitter bots that is at all “interactive”—every previous bot used the REST APIs to post, but can not engage with things in their timeline or tweeted at them.</p>

<p>That change meant I had to use a slightly different architecture than I’ve used before. Each of my previous bots were small and self-contained scripts that produced a tweet or two each time they run. That design means I can trigger them with a cron job that runs at regular intervals. By contrast, <span class="citation">@LinkArchiver</span> runs all the time, listening to its timeline and acting when it needs to. It doesn’t have much interactive behavior—when you tweet at it directly, it can reply with a Wayback link, but that’s it—but learning this kind of structure will enable me to do much more interactive bots in the future.</p>

<p>It also required that I figure out how to “daemonize” the script, so that it could run in the background when I wasn’t connected and restart in case it crashed (or when I restart the computer). I found this aspect surprisingly difficult; it seems like a really basic need, but the documentation for how to do this was not especially easy to find. I host my bots on a Digital Ocean box running Ubuntu, so this script is running as a systemd service. The <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units">Digital Ocean documentation</a> and this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/4vhofs/creating_a_systemd_daemon_so_you_can_run_a_python/">Reddit tutorial</a> were both very helpful for my figuring it out.</p>

<p>Since launching the bot, I’ve gotten in touch with the folks at the Wayback Machine, and at their request added a custom user-agent. I was worried that the bot would get on their nerves, but they seem to really appreciate it—what a relief. After its first four days online, it’s tracking some 3,400 users and has sent about 25,000 links to the Internet Archive.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="archives" /><category term="bots" /><category term="internet archive" /><category term="programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="twitter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter users who want to ensure that the Wayback Machine has stored a copy of the pages they link to can now sign up with @LinkArchiver to make it happen automatically. @LinkArchiver is the first project I’ve worked on in my 12-week stay at Recurse Center, where I’m learning to be a better programmer.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Twitter bot after artist Gerhard Richter</title><link href="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2017/01/new-twitter-bot-artist-gerhard-richter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Twitter bot after artist Gerhard Richter" /><published>2017-01-26T13:06:35-05:00</published><updated>2017-01-26T13:06:35-05:00</updated><id>https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2017/01/new-twitter-bot-artist-gerhard-richter</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2017/01/new-twitter-bot-artist-gerhard-richter/"><![CDATA[<p>This week I went to the SFMOMA for the first time.

He made a few “256 Colors” and a bunch of other color charts, some of which are more explicitly generative—that is, where the colors and their arrangement are left to chance.</p>

The New Yorker called it <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/03/the-nancy-book">“his miniaturist memoir-poem,”</a> and Paul Auster’s blurb for the 2001 edition gives a good sense of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I Remember</em> is a masterpiece. One by one, the so-called important books of our time will be forgotten, but Joe Brainard’s modest little gem will endure. In simple, forthright, declarative sentences, he charts the map of the human soul and permanently alters the way we look at the world. <em>I Remember</em> is both uproariously funny and deeply moving. It is also one of the few totally original books I have ever read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those simple declarative sentences—almost all of which begin with “I remember…”—would have been a shock as a book, but today they have the strange familiarity of status updates from your most nostalgic friend.</p>

<p>So when Avery Trufelman asked <a href="https://twitter.com/trufelman/status/820687962266402816">if somebody could make a bot</a> that tweeted his “memories,” I jumped at the chance.

<blockquote>
  <p>Recently, Higgins hoped to make an iterator bot out of turn-of-the-century popular music that had been digitized by the New York Public Library. But quite a lot of the scanned sheet music was, to say the least, <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-eef6-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99">extremely racist</a>. So he scrapped the whole idea. “It was acceptable at the time, but that’s not what I would want my bot to say,” said Higgins. Loosely paraphrasing Darius Kazemi, he said, “My bot is not me, and should not be read as me. But it’s something that I’m responsible for. It’s sort of like a child in that way—you don’t want to see your child misbehave.”</p>

<p>In fact, there’s a whole <a href="https://twitter.com/hugovk/lists/tiny-universe">“tiny universe” of bots</a> that tweet emoji scenes—most prominently, Katie Rose Pipkin’s amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/tiny_star_field">“tiny star fields”</a>. But as far as I could tell, none of them have trains. So I set to work putting my trains into some tiny landscapes, and quickly got something together.</p>

<p>Friday morning I “launched” the bot, by <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/708337788286992384">tweeting about it</a> from my own account. I’m not sure what reaction I expected, but it wasn’t this one: over the course of the next 24 hours, over a thousand people followed it. By 10 tweets in or so, it had surpassed <a href="https://twitter.com/pomological">@pomological</a> as my most popular bot. Over the weekend it climbed to 1,600 followers and it seems to still be on the rise.</p>

<p>Best of all though, I’m getting nice feedback from people speaking all different languages. That’s something I don’t usually get when I’m writing, but of course these “scenes”—if you can even call them that—are equally intelligible in any language. It feels really great to know that people around the world like this thing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/choochoobot">source code is online</a>, and I’ll write up more of a how-to soon. More excitingly, I want to keep developing out the possibilities here. Even out of the idea phase, it’s still a goofy project, but it’s a fun canvas to explore some more elaborate ideas.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bots" /><category term="emoji" /><category term="programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="trains" /><category term="twitter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a goofy idea: After a few happy-hour drinks on Thursday, I decided to write a little Python script to make emoji “trains” of random length, combining the steam engine with the two styles of rail cars.
