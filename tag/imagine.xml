Cory likes to talk about how his fiction “predicts the present”: taking the bits of future that are already here, just not yet evenly distributed, and applying them more widely. It’s a neat trick that makes his sci-fi seem eerily prescient, and I know <cite>Little Brother</cite> has been boosted by supporters of Occupy who saw much of their story foretold in his writing.</p>

<p>In another of Cory’s young adult books, the recent <a href="http://craphound.com/pc/about/"><cite>Pirate Cinema</cite></a>, much of the plot focuses on draconian copyright enforcement systems and backlash. Of course, there’s a rich history to pull from: the battles over SOPA and ACTA were just the latest in a long narrative that Cory has been engaged with for years. His “Theft of Intellectual Property Bill (TIP)” might have been fiction, but it’s a logical extension of what we’ve already seen.</p>

<p>Combine predicting the present with some old-fashioned coincidence, and things start to get spooky. Take Cory’s “Jimmy Preston,” who in <cite>Pirate Cinema</cite> gets a then-unprecedented five-year prison term for sharing music files. Cory writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But he’d collected 450,000 songs on his hard drive through endless, tedious, tireless hours of downloading. From what anyone could tell, he didn’t even listen to them: he just liked cataloging them, correcting their metadata, organizing them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare that to the real-life Jeremiah Perkins, who just a few months after <cite>Pirate Cinema</cite>‘s release was <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/record-filing-sharing-term/">also sentenced to five years for filesharing</a>. According to a report prepared on behalf ot the movie studios, his group iMAGINE was well-known for <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/imagine-bittorrent-piracy-group-sysop-jailed-40-months-121130/">“their consistently good quality of audio captures” and “their high volume of releases”</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that Jeremiah Perkins doesn’t face the same ultimate fate as Cory’s Jimmy Preston, who didn’t do well in prison. Even more importantly, I hope we don’t see more jailtime for filesharers.</p>

<p>When the book came out, I saw at least one review that said the action was too over-the-top, the law too excessive, the studio groups too vindictive to possibly reflect reality. Detractors should take note: when the book came out, the mainstream probably wouldn’t believe a five-year sentence for file-sharing. Then it happened. Cory’s good at predicting the present.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="cory doctorow" /><category term="file sharing" /><category term="imagine" /><category term="piracy" /><category term="pirate cinema" /><category term="sopa" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cory Doctorow is coming through town again, this time on his tour for Homeland, the sequel to his excellent young adult novel Little Brother.
