To that end, I’ve been toying around with the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">Social Security Administration’s baby name dataset</a>, which records the number of babies born with each given name every year, both federally and at the state level. Because I’ve also been watching <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> along with the <a href="http://foreverdogproductions.com/fdpn/podcasts/treks-and-the-city/">Treks And The City podcast</a>, I chose to dig into information about the name “Wesley.”</p>

<p>On my first pass through the data I noticed that the name’s popularity dramatically spiked around 1976, and then tapered off for a few decades after. Honestly, that spike is the most interesting property of the whole graph, and I can’t explain it very well. But a funny secondary effect is that neither <em>TNG</em>‘s premiere nor the release of <em>The Princess Bride</em>—both in 1987—could prop up the name as it declined in popularity. The effect makes it look like it’s tumbling off a cliff, instead of regressing to the mean. This graph, including the label, was generated in Python’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matplotlib</code>.</p>

<p>After looking at the federal data, I decided to dig into the state-level stuff, to give me a (long-anticipated!) opportunity to generate a choropleth map. Again, I cleaned up the data in Python, and then generated a map using a Javascript library called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href="https://d3-geomap.github.io/"&gt;d3-geomap&lt;/a&gt;</code>. For a long time I’ve wanted to get more familiar with its parent library, d3, and this has been a nice opportunity to dip my toe into that.</p>

Abbott</a>, a case addressing the question of whether the “one-person, one-vote” principle of the Equal Protection Clause allows states to use total population data instead of voter population data in apportioning legislative districts.</p>

<p>Turns out, “data” came up a lot!</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="435" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EBCxr14AoBA" width="580"></iframe>

<p>This follows a supercut last year of mentions of the word “cloud” in the ABC v. Aereo argument, <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2014/04/supreme-court-clouds/">“Supreme Court Clouds (2014)”</a>. The process of making this video was largely similar, though I’ve traded in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mencoder</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg</code> for cutting up, modifying, and muxing the video.</p>

<p>This time I thought it’d be nice to include some background music, so I turned to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/musopen-chopin">public domain recordings of various Chopin compositions</a>, created by Musopen. For the video, I used a segment of a <a href="https://archive.org/details/6235_Information_Machine_The_01_29_03_15">1958 educational film about computers</a> made by IBM and sourced from the Prelinger Archive.</p>

<p>Both media sources, as well as the Supreme Court audio, are public domain. (All for different reasons, too: the music because of an intentional waiver of rights; the video because it was not noticed-and-registered and was made in an era that required formalities; and the courtroom audio because of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105">§ 105 barring federal employees from copyright</a> on their official work.)</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="art" /><category term="data" /><category term="mash-ups" /><category term="supercut" /><category term="supreme court" /><category term="video" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s a supercut of all the mentions of the word “data” in last week’s Supreme Court Oral Arguments in Evenwel v.
