<p>That year has some copyright and public domain significance. For twenty years following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act</a>, 1922 was the most recent publication year for which a given work could be categorically determined to be in the public domain. That made “1922 and earlier” <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151102/16255832697/copyright-terms-how-historical-journalism-is-disappearing.shtml">a common category for digitized databases</a> of older works. On January 1, that border advanced for the first time in two decades, and the zine is something of a celebration of that fact.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>The zines sold out quickly—I only intended to offer a hundred subscriptions, which were snapped up in about two hours—and so I added a “digital subscription” option. That meant I would have to figure out how to distribute the zines digitally too, but I was probably going to want to do that anyhow.</p>

<p>I sent out and posted (for backers only) the first two issues together after the campaign closed in the beginning of February. This week I sent out and posted the third issue, and so I’ve removed the “paywall” for the first two.</p>

<p>Which means: you can now check out the January and Feburary issues of <em>1923</em> at <a href="https://1923.press/">1923.press</a>.</p>

<p>This has been a big endeavor for me, and I’ve had to learn a lot about a tiny area of publishing and fulfillment.</p>

<p>In the coming days I’m going to publish some notes about my zine-creating process, which I think is sort of idiosyncratic but may also be instructional. I’ve written a few scripts and one-liners to ease the process, and I’d love if those ended up being helpful to other zine makers!</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="kickstarter" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="publishing" /><category term="zine" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Towards the beginning of this year I ran a Kickstarter campaign for a monthly zine of archival material from the year 1923.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot_2019-02-16_11-56-40.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot_2019-02-16_11-56-40.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Online communities under threat in new copyright decision</title><link href="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2017/04/online-communities-threat-new-copyright-decision/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Online communities under threat in new copyright decision" /><published>2017-04-09T13:19:07-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-09T13:19:07-04:00</updated><id>https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2017/04/online-communities-threat-new-copyright-decision</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2017/04/online-communities-threat-new-copyright-decision/"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2017/04/08/mavrix-livejournal-9thcir.pdf">Ninth Circuit copyright decision</a> in <em>Mavrix v. LiveJournal</em> could bring nasty implications for online communities, threatening the copyright “safe harbor” provisions that allows those communities to form.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Ninth Circuit has said that volunteer moderators of online communities may be considered “agents” of the platform they’re on, and that if those moderators learn about copyright infringements (or “red flags” that suggest infringements) that it’s like the platform itself learning about them. That’s really important, because platforms can only claim the “safe harbor” provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) if they do not have that kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>Being in that safe harbor is generally considered a pre-requesite to operating a large platform for user-generated content. So the concern goes: if platforms can’t allow volunteer moderators to curate communities without incurring massive copyright liability, they may decide to disable community moderation altogether.</p>

<p>Two major caveats here. The first is that the Ninth Circuit didn’t say these moderators <em>are</em> “agents” of the platform. It just said that the lower court was too hasty in saying they were not, and that a trial was necessary to decide. That’s still bad news, though. The companies that run major platforms generally will go to great lengths to avoid the expense and uncertainty of a trial. If a volunteer-moderated community is a magnet for litigation, platforms may decide it’s not worth it.</p>

<p>The second is that defendant LiveJournal’s handling of the situation may have exposed it to more risk than other companies or platforms face. In particular, it hired an active moderator to be the “primary leader” of the community in question. That employee relationship muddies the waters when it comes to agency, though it will be up to the lower court to articulate how exactly that works out.</p>

<p>Still, even if the moderator draws a paycheck from the platform, it seems unreasonable to expect them to approach thorny copyright questions with the nuance of a trained professional. That is especially true when you compare this ruling with the Ninth Circuit’s most recent opinion in <em>Lenz v. Universal</em>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/lenz-v-universal">“dancing baby” case</a>, which looks down the other end of the copyright gun at takedown notice senders. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/takedown-senders-must-consider-fair-use-ninth-circuit-rules">Notice senders must consider fair use</a>, but only so far as to form a “subjective good faith belief” about it. If courts don’t require the people sending a takedown notice to form an objectively reasonable interpretation of the law, why should they impose a higher standard on the moderators at platforms handling staggering quantities of user uploads?</p>

<p>But if moderators are a platform’s “agents,” then it runs into trouble if they have actual or “red flag” knowledge of infringements. The Ninth Circuit has instructed the lower court to find out whether the moderators had either. Noting the watermarks on some of the copyrighted images in the case, the court phrased the question of “red flag” knowledge as whether “it would be objectively obvious to a reasonable person that material bearing a generic watermark or a watermark referring to a service provider’s website was infringing.” That’s an important point to watch. Copyright ownership and licensing can be extremely complex — so oversimplifying it to the idea that the presence of a watermark means any use is infringing would have profound negative consequences.</p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit decision kicking it back down to the district court means that these questions are very much in play. And it could already mean, as EFF puts it, that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/ninth-circuit-sends-message-platforms-use-moderator-go-trial">using moderators means you will have to go all the way to trial</a>.</p>

<p>There’s one more troubling aspect of the opinion that drives home the cost of such a trial: anonymous moderators, whom LiveJournal was previously able to protect from deposition, may now be forced to appear.</p>

<p>The chilling effect here is very serious. <em>Mavrix</em>, already a closely watched case, is poised to attract even more attention as a district court grapples with these big questions. The fate of moderated online communities could hang in the balance.</p>

Last month, when Elon Musk’s privately held company SpaceX posted photos taken during a successful satellite launch, I noted that, unlike every picture NASA has ever taken, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/why-photos-of-space-should-belong-to-everyone/385681/">these wouldn’t enter the public domain immediately</a> by default. It may have been an unintended side effect of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105">the copyright rule about government works</a>, but for whatever reason the public domain grew with each space photo, and that would be stopping. That’s a bummer, and <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/02/earth-elon-please-let-public-domain-space-photos/">I called for Elon Musk to fix it</a> by dedicating his company’s new photos to the public domain.</p>

<p>This month, we’ve had a victory in two parts. First, after press inquiries and the like, SpaceX announced that it would be opening <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos/">a repository of photos on Flickr</a>, and that beyond just allowing public access, it would <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/spacex-releases-its-photos-under-creative-commons/388200/">release those photos under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>. I don’t love NonCommercial licenses for <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC">a lot of reasons</a>, but still, that was a nice show of good faith and I appreciated that a major company would take the effort.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Launch_of_Falcon_9_carrying_ASIASAT_6_16169087563.jpg" alt="Launch_of_Falcon_9_carrying_ASIASAT_6_(16169087563)" /></p>

<p>But then another remarkable thing happened. When Musk tweeted about putting those photos online, somebody replied suggesting the public domain—<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/22/8272153/elon-musk-spacex-photos-public-domain">and then Musk agreed</a>. It was a remarkable exchange, and just a few minutes later he declared that he’d changed the license.</p>

<p>There was some confusion, as Flickr doesn’t generally allow photos to be marked as truly public domain—that would require a CC0 waiver, or a declaration that the photos otherwise have no restrictions—so on that platform they were instead set to the most permissive license available, Creative Commons Attribution. Jessamyn West wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/message/why-spacex-s-photos-maybe-aren-t-public-domain-5c7f156572f5">great post</a> explaining how that meant that the photos weren’t <em>really</em> in the public domain, for some purposes.</p>

<p>But on SpaceX’s own site, they are <a href="http://www.spacex.com/media">clearly marked with a CC0 waiver</a>. And as such, they’ve been <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs_by_SpaceX">uploaded to platforms like the Wikimedia Commons</a>, where they can bear the same freedoms. This may be a small campaign—targeting just one company, and not changing any systemic policies—but the victory is real and exciting. Thank you, Elon Musk, for setting an example and helping to grow the public domain.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="elon musk" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="spacex" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an exciting time for photographs from space.

From my piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But in the last week or so, the docket filings have been piling up and the judge has <a href="https://ia801902.us.archive.org/20/items/gov.uscourts.cacd.569559/gov.uscourts.cacd.569559.231.0.pdf">changed course on that position</a>. The Gaye estate had already filed mash-ups of the two songs to demonstrate how similar they were. Perhaps inspired by those recordings, the judge suggested an unusual and uniquely modern twist: both sides could try submitting versions of “Got To Give It Up” that consist of <em>only</em> the copyrighted elements of the song. In other words, both sides should agree how to distil “Got To Give It Up” down to its basic copyrighty essence — a fire mixtape of pure copyrightium.</p>

  <p>Both sides eventually agreed to this condition and edited together the versions of “Got To Give It Up” the jury is likely to hear. If it’s not written down in the sheet music it’s off the table, meaning that the courtroom version of “Got To Give It Up” likely sounds like the MIDI version that auto-played on a Geocities home page, or a rendition by the animatronic band at Chuck E. Cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since that was published, my <em>Ratter</em> editor Kate was able to get and publish a copy of the actual courtroom recordings, and we were relieved to hear <a href="http://ratter.com/heres-the-pivotal-track-of-the-blurred-lines-copyrigh-1686896366">they sound about as weird as we’d hoped</a>.</p>

<p>In a sense, I think this case mirrors <em>Aereo</em>, but for music. That is to say, it’s undisputed that Pharrell and Thicke wanted to emulate the sound of “Got To Give It Up,” and attempted to do so in a way that deliberately complied with the law. One of the perverse outcomes of <em>Aereo</em> is that it creates the sense that a careful compliance with the law might be deemed a violation—”too cute by half,” maybe, or a Rube Goldberg machine. I hope that doesn’t happen with “Blurred Lines,” because it’s the concept of musical influence that would suffer.</p>

<p>Now after several delays, the trial begins today! While I was hoping to make it, I’ll have to watch from afar.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="blurred lines" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="ratter" /><category term="writing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a piece for a new-ish publication called Ratter about the impending copyright trial between Pharrell, Robin Thicke, and the estate of Marvin Gaye, about whether the song “Blurred Lines” infringes on “Got To Give It Up.” In particular, the judge has done some unusual things in terms of what is allowable evidence, given that the Gaye song predates the lifting of notice-and-registration requirements, so only the material in the deposited copy of the sheet music is covered by copyright, under the 1909 Act.

It would continue a tradition of unrestricted space photos that began with NASA’s images—necessarily public domain, coming from a U.S. government agency—but which is <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/when-spacex-takes-photos-on-a-nasa-mission-copyright-law-explodes">jeopardized when space photographs come from private companies</a>.</p>

(Like for example: it strikes me as just impossibly sad that none of the photos of the retiring shuttle being flown over the US—take <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/7088014787/">this beautiful shot over D.C.</a>, to pick just one—likely won’t be in the public domain for another century.)</p>

<p>A robust and well-documented space program is a major boon for motivating young people to study science. Images from space have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble#cite_note-NASAmarble-2">formed the basis of major social movements</a>, and been the <a href="http://sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/WholeEarth_buton.html">target of activism campaigns</a>.</p>

<p>And just generally, it’s an incredibly valuable thing that U.S. government works go straight to the public domain. Lots of other countries don’t have that, despite the common-sense logic behind it: we, the taxpayers, already paid for the work, which requires no additional incentive to be produced. To see that value get chipped away by private deals would be tragic.</p>

<p>All this is to say, society has gotten so much out of media from space being free for all to share, and that shouldn’t end as private companies get access.

<p>At issue was whether these posters—which were certainly creative, but just as certainly commercial—could be restricted by copyright. By ruling in favor of the plaintiff, the Supreme Court made it clear that the bar for copyright eligibility is not some abstract notion of artistic merit, but simple originality. Commercial speech was just as qualified as fine art. From Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr’s <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=188&amp;page=239">majority opinion</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme, some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Manet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. Yet if they command the interest of any public, they have a commercial value — it would be bold to say that they have not an aesthetic and educational value — and the taste of any public is not to be treated with contempt. It is an ultimate fact for the moment, whatever may be our hopes for a change. That these pictures had their worth and their success is sufficiently shown by the desire to reproduce them without regard to the plaintiffs’ rights.</p>

<p>I’d read about this case many times, but had never seen high quality copies of the three posters at the heart of the matter. After a bit of digging, I found copies in the Library of Congress, which have been scanned at an extremely high resolution. I’ve cropped, cleaned up, and color-corrected the images in this post, but if you’ve got any interest I strongly recommend downloading the huge TIFF files from the LoC. Descriptions of each image by Holmes himself:</p>

<p>Nowadays it seems obvious that these creative and original images would be subject to copyright. It’s a nice reminder that the assumptions of today are likely just as brittle as the ones that affected these colorful posters over a century ago.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bleistein v. donaldson" /><category term="circus" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="images" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="supreme court" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 1903 Supreme Court ruling in Bleistein v.

Per the comic, Lichtenstein sold the painting for four million dollars. (I’m not sure where that figure comes from, as another source says he <a href="http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Who+opposed+a+%C2%A34%2c665+Lichtenstein%3f/28512">sold it in 1966 for under £4,000</a>.)</p>

<p>Some of the people sharing this comic—like <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/11/07/lichtensteins-theft-and-the.html">BoingBoing</a>, for example—describe Lichtenstein’s appropriation as “theft.” The short comic doesn’t use that word, but there’s an implication that there’s some kind of injustice here: Lichtenstein got paid and Heath did not, and the comic suggests that’s a problem.</p>

<p>But if something was stolen from Heath, what was it? What is it that Heath doesn’t have, that he would have if Lichtenstein had never appropriated the panel?</p>

<p>There’s a labor story here: talented and hard-working artists from the golden era of comic books were poorly compensated, and frequently taken advantage of. There’s a social welfare story here: independent of Heath’s stature as an artist, it’s shameful that 80-year-olds can’t afford groceries or medical bills.</p>

<p>But I don’t think there’s really a copyright story. Worse, I think the implication that Lichtenstein “owed” Heath something for his success ignores two truths about what copyright isn’t.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contributing value doesn’t give you a right to control or capitalize on it. Lessig <a href="http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-3.html">describes the mistake in <em>Free Culture</em></a>, and attributes the “if-value-then-right” formulation to Rochelle Dreyfuss: <em>if</em> some creative work is valuable, <em>then</em> somebody has a right to control that value. Of course, much of the value of creative works is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability">non-excludable</a> anyway, but that’s a feature, not a bug.</li>
  <li>Copyright is not a lottery ticket: copyright policy shouldn’t be geared towards capturing as much as possible of the money exchanged on extremely rare runaway successes. That’s the same mentality that makes a man standing near a monkey taking a selfie feel like he ought to make a living off that photo for life.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m quite glad that the <a href="http://www.heroinitiative.org/">Hero Initiative</a> is stepping in to support comics professionals who need it. I don’t think an artist’s healthcare options should depend on how commercially successful their work—or licensed derivatives of it—continue to be.</p>

<p>As with the <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/12/a-closer-look-at-the-girl-on-fire-copyright-lawsuit/">songwriter who sued Alicia Keyes</a> for infringement two years ago, I feel genuinely bad for the older artist who has fallen on hard times. But in both cases, the solution is not to try to expand copyright to cover them. Given what the Hero Initiative says about comic artists, and the fact that musicians, too, are <a href="https://www.futureofmusic.org/article/research/taking-pulse-survey-health-insurance-and-musicians">uninsured at twice the rate of the general population</a>, there’s definitely a policy that needs to change—but it’s a social one, not economic.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="appropriation" /><category term="comics" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="roy lichtenstein" /><category term="russ heath" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an emotionally compelling comic going around now that shows some of the hardships artist Russ Heath faced in the decades after Roy Lichtenstein appropriated one of his panels in a now famous painting.
