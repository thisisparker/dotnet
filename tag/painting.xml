Follow along for two daily reminders of the beauty of randomness.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="art" /><category term="bots" /><category term="gerhard richter" /><category term="painting" /><category term="twitter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week I went to the SFMOMA for the first time.
