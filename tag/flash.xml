Fortunately, my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/omidaladini">Omid</a>, who is a SoundCloud developer, has found a solution.</p>

<p>It turns out the problem is caused by a “Linux-specific security feature” (read: <a href="https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-1211">bug</a> [login required]) that prevents a Flash settings dialogue from appearing when wmode=opaque is used. In any case, there are a few easy workarounds.</p>

<p>If you’ve got the flash-player-properties package installed (which, at least on Ubuntu, ships separately from the flash-plugin, but is available in the standard repositories), you can add “a1.sndcdn.com” to the allowed sites under the “Camera &amp; Mic” tab of that program.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you’ve unsuccessfully attempted to record at least once on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/upload">the SoundCloud upload page</a>, you can add a1.sndcdn.com from the Flash player’s <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html">web settings panel</a>. While you’re there, check your security settings!</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful to other SoundCloud users on Linux who haven’t quite been able to get recording working.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="flash" /><category term="howto" /><category term="soundcloud" /><category term="ubuntu" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since it was introduced, the SoundCloud Record button has been hard to get to work in Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux distributions.
