<p>In any case, it’s got a very distinctive style, and I wanted to see more maps with that look. So I made a version of the San Francisco BART map in that look.</p>

<p>It inspired me to look up Clipper Card’s policy. As I suspected, it doesn’t report any similar numbers, but it says in <a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/faq.do#using">its FAQ</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>personal information will not be disclosed to third parties, except as required by law, ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, or where the express written consent of the Clipper cardholder has been obtained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/privacy.do">the full privacy policy</a>, Clipper notes that it retains personally identifiable information for up to seven years. It also doesn’t include ride patterns as personally identifiable.</p>

<p>MTA’s info for New York City is apparently even less complete. Though the website has <a href="http://www.mta.info/accountability/">a whole section labeled “Transparency”</a>, it’s dedicated to budget and governance issues. In fact, <a href="http://www.mta.info/mta/privacy.htm">the only privacy policy I could find on the site</a> pertains strictly to use of the website itself.</p>

<p>Even though there’s no obvious policy, MTA info has been publicly used in police proceedings. In 2008 it made the front page of the New York Times when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/nyregion/19metrocard.html?pagewanted=all">MetroCard data got a suspect off of murder charges</a>. An MTA employee in the article is quoted as saying that there would be a three-month wait time to retrieve the evidence, because “We’re very busy. We’ve got all these requests.”</p>

<p>(Interestingly, it didn’t make the front page when the charge was actually dropped, but the same reporter covered it for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/nyregion/01murder.html?_r=1">the New York section of the paper</a> and <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/after-metrocard-alibi-murder-charges-are-dropped/">the City Room blog</a>. The two articles were released on the evening of New Year’s Eve 2008, and are nearly identical. One of the only differences is a sentence omitted from the blog post version, saying “The transit agency says it receives periodic requests to trace information.”)</p>

<p>This information seems to be a nice target for public records requests. Let me know if you’re interested in initiating some of those.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bart" /><category term="eric king" /><category term="new york" /><category term="privacy" /><category term="public transit" /><category term="san francisco" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eric King recently posted a link to London’s Oyster Card FAQ page explaining Transport for London’s policy on requests for information from police — it rejects 5-10% of requests for providing insufficient information.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nyan BART</title><link href="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/05/nyan-bart/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nyan BART" /><published>2012-05-11T15:02:15-04:00</published><updated>2012-05-11T15:02:15-04:00</updated><id>https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/05/nyan-bart</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/05/nyan-bart/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_100691.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_100691.jpg" alt="" title="Nyan BART" /></a></p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bart" /><category term="internet" /><category term="nyan cat" /><category term="pictures" /><category term="public transit" /><category term="san francisco" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
