<p>In fact, the picture got enough retweets and replies that I decided to make <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/733102946188066818">stickers</a>. And <a href="https://teespring.com/you-wouldnt-reimplement-an-api">t-shirts</a>. And each of those things have gotten more attention than I expected. It’s been really exciting! I don’t have a distribution plan for the stickers besides handing them out in person (and self-addressed stamped envelopes to me at EFF), but there will be more than 300 t-shirts out there in the world. That blows my <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/01/making-alice-bob-tees/">Alice &amp; Bob design</a> out of the water.</p>

<p>All this for being a pretty esoteric design. For one thing, the API reimplementation issue being litigated in Oracle is pretty arcane. For another, it relies on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU">an anti-piracy reference that’s a decade-plus old</a> at this point.</p>

<p>The shirts will be donezo Monday evening—if anybody wants to print their own, here are the high-res source files you can send to a printer or put on a screen yourself. (The first one is white on transparent, so you have to change the background to see it.) I’d love to see your take on it!</p>

<p>I moved a month ago, September 1, to a new corner in San Francisco. In two years here, I’ve lived in the Mission, in Noe Valley, in Bernal Heights, in Pacific Heights, and now in Hayes Valley. The picture above is my corner, as photographed by the Google Street View car in April 2011.</p>

<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://www.oldsf.org/#">OldSF</a>, here’s a photo of the same corner (same angle!) from 1929:</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AAB-3659.jpg" alt="AAB-3659" /></p>

<p>Look at the stairs, across the street on the left side, and how they match with the current construction. And across the street on the right, the building now obscured by a tree but just the same.</p>

<p>Even more exciting to me, from the same site, is the photo from a year earlier, in 1928:</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AAB-3671.jpg" alt="AAB-3671" /></p>

<p>A horse, right there on the street! And look, on this side of the street, on the left, the building is under construction.</p>

<p>San Francisco’s got a lot of interesting history for a relatively new place. It’s nice to feel like I’m part of it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="google" /><category term="history" /><category term="san francisco" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The impossibility of imagining information retrieval in the past</title><link href="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/04/the-impossibility-of-imagining-information-discovery-in-the-past/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The impossibility of imagining information retrieval in the past" /><published>2012-04-28T23:04:32-04:00</published><updated>2012-04-28T23:04:32-04:00</updated><id>https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/04/the-impossibility-of-imagining-information-discovery-in-the-past</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/04/the-impossibility-of-imagining-information-discovery-in-the-past/"><![CDATA[<blockquote>

<p>–<a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6089/the-art-of-fiction-no-211-william-gibson">William Gibson, interviewed in the Paris Review no. 211</a></p>

<p>There’s a whole class of information that’s both trivially easy for Web-literate people to access today and virtually impossible to access with tools from even 10 or 15 years ago.</p>

<p>I’ve thought about this fact for a while, and one of my favorite examples has been the names of members of a band. It’s one Google or Wikipedia search away, but as Gibson suggests above, I almost cannot conceive of how to determine this without those tools.</p>

<p>Seriously: what could you do? Such information would not likely be in an encyclopedia, and maybe not in any printed reference books. You could ask at a record store, or call a radio station or the label they were on (after finding a number on the back of an LP, in a catalog, or calling an operator in the city in which they were based).</p>

<p>I’d used that example to describe the phenomenon for a long time before finding one of my favorite sections of the Wikipedia, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_%28band%29#Timeline">timeline of the members of Journey</a>, ((It’s also dynamically generated with a plug-in called Timeline, which makes it semantically significant and editable. It’s a pretty incredible thing.)) embedded teeny-tiny here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_%28band%29#Timeline"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-28-at-7.38.48-PM.png" alt="" title="Timeline of the members of Journey" /></a></p>

<p>The difference is incredible. And it’s easier (for me at least) to imagine getting this information through an augmented reality pop-up or piped into a heads-up display than to get it in any analog way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="future" /><category term="google" /><category term="information" /><category term="journey" /><category term="paris review" /><category term="wikipedia" /><category term="william gibson" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s harder to imagine the past that went away than it is to imagine the future.
