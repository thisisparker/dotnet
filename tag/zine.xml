<p>That year has some copyright and public domain significance. For twenty years following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act</a>, 1922 was the most recent publication year for which a given work could be categorically determined to be in the public domain. That made “1922 and earlier” <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151102/16255832697/copyright-terms-how-historical-journalism-is-disappearing.shtml">a common category for digitized databases</a> of older works. On January 1, that border advanced for the first time in two decades, and the zine is something of a celebration of that fact.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>The zines sold out quickly—I only intended to offer a hundred subscriptions, which were snapped up in about two hours—and so I added a “digital subscription” option. That meant I would have to figure out how to distribute the zines digitally too, but I was probably going to want to do that anyhow.</p>

<p>I sent out and posted (for backers only) the first two issues together after the campaign closed in the beginning of February. This week I sent out and posted the third issue, and so I’ve removed the “paywall” for the first two.</p>

<p>Which means: you can now check out the January and Feburary issues of <em>1923</em> at <a href="https://1923.press/">1923.press</a>.</p>

<p>This has been a big endeavor for me, and I’ve had to learn a lot about a tiny area of publishing and fulfillment.</p>

<p>In the coming days I’m going to publish some notes about my zine-creating process, which I think is sort of idiosyncratic but may also be instructional. I’ve written a few scripts and one-liners to ease the process, and I’d love if those ended up being helpful to other zine makers!</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="kickstarter" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="publishing" /><category term="zine" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Towards the beginning of this year I ran a Kickstarter campaign for a monthly zine of archival material from the year 1923.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot_2019-02-16_11-56-40.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot_2019-02-16_11-56-40.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
