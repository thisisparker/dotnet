The conference was dedicated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_art">mail art</a>, and today’s panels featured a handful of people that have been in that scene for decades, including these two:</p>

<p>Those are pictures I took today of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Banana">Anna Banana</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Darling">Lowell Darling</a>. (I added Anna’s to her existing Wikipedia article, and created a new one for Lowell.)</p>

<p>I wasn’t really familiar with mail art at all and after today I feel like I’ve been missing out. But you could hardly get a better introduction than the one I had today: incredibly friendly leaders of the community having a great time meeting in person and sharing stories about the 40+ year history of the art movement.</p>

<p>Actually, it felt a lot like a hacker conference, but for a totally different community.</p>

<p>Speaking of hacker parallels, I was struck by how the timelines of the mail art community and the golden age of phone phreaking lined up. It’s really striking because in neither case was it really facilitated by new technical developments. Rather it was just people digging in and really exploring the communications networks they were using.</p>

<p>I had a great time and plan to dig more into mail art in the next few weeks. One fun project might be to try to find a cheap pinhole perforator to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistamp">artistamps</a>—or to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaCn7HWJ1YU">fashion one out of an old sewing machine</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="libraries" /><category term="mail art" /><category term="san francisco" /><category term="wikipedia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I got a chance to check out the last day of the Ex Postal Facto conference, made up of a few panels at the San Francisco Public Library.

Anyway, there are a few shots of a pretty incredible location that caught my eye. Psy and his crew are dancing on a set of steps, surrounded by shelves full of books.</p>

<p>At first I thought this was a bookstore, but a little digging revealed that they’re dancing in <a href="http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Society/view?articleId=103347">the new Seoul Metropolitan Library, which is housed in the former City Hall building</a>. That building was built under Japanese Colonial Rule in 1926, and later served as the headquarters for the municipal government until 2008. There were plans for the building to be demolished, but those plans proved unpopular.</p>

<p>In October 2012, Psy performed <a href="http://gawker.com/5949254/psy-performs-free-thank-you-concert-in-seoul-literally-shuts-the-city-down">his free “thank you” concert</a> in front of this building, drawing 80,000 fans and shutting down major parts of the city.</p>

<p>Later that month, it was re-opened as a library, and now houses 200,000 books on seven floors. It looks like a pretty incredible space.</p>

<p>As somebody on Twitter notes, though, the library’s about <a href="https://twitter.com/NextStopOrBust/status/323278272270041090">a 40-50 minute subway ride from Gangnam</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="gangnam style" /><category term="gentleman" /><category term="korea" /><category term="libraries" /><category term="psy" /><category term="seoul" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Psy — he, of course, of “Gangnam Style” fame — is back with a second video called “Gentleman.” A day into its existence, it’s pushing 30 million views.

When you connect to the open wifi network, you’re given this notice and the ability to click right through:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>San Francisco Public Library is committed to providing free and equal Internet access to the public without filtering content. We do, however, ask that you respect your fellow library users and refrain from viewing obscene, offensive, harmful matter, or illegal materials prohibited by law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There may be some uncertainty about what the future of public libraries looks like, but everybody ought to agree that it involves sticking to their core values of free and private access to the information of the world. Asking patrons to be respectful of the other people in the library is a good thing; imposing rigid software-based filters is not.</p>

<p>That’s why, while I personally think it’s not a very great idea to watch porn in a library, the Seattle Public is correct in <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-library-lets-man-watch-porn-despite-2873692.php">not installing filters or otherwise censoring what people are allowed to access</a>.</p>

<p>That’s the right idea even if we assume these are perfect filters that have no false positives and no false negatives. As Cory Doctorow has pointed out in a compelling criticism of UK censorship efforts, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/nov/13/children-porn-starbucks">that’s never the case, and the collateral damage can be dramatic</a>.</p>

<p>Even in places where there’s not the same institutional commitment to free access to information, it’s rarely effective and frequently frustrating to start censoring a list of sites or even arbitrarily defined categories of sites. For example, it’s hard to justify the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120918/12131620417/usptos-reality-distortion-field-web-filter-blocks-critics-like-eff-welcomes-maximalist-lobbyists.shtml">US Patent and Trademark office blocking EFF’s site, among others, on their guest wifi</a>, and airlines are behaving a bit silly when they <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27199289/ns/travel-travel_tips/t/cover-your-eyes-not-all-airlines-will-filter-wi-fi/#.UNZKtInjkoY">install filters on their inflight wifi</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="censorship" /><category term="cory doctorow" /><category term="libraries" /><category term="san francisco" /><category term="seattle" /><category term="wifi" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The San Francisco Public Library has the right idea about offering unfiltered Internet access.

<p>Not to diminish Wikipedia’s importance in the encyclopedia world and Britannica’s decision, but there are a lot of reasons why a choice made in 1768 to distribute 32 volumes of printed book might be worth re-evaluating in 2012. Wikipedia’s open and collaborative authorship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Errors_in_the_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_that_have_been_corrected_in_Wikipedia">certainly has its advantages</a>, but Carmody identifies a more important difference between the two organizations: Britannica’s business depended on the books being seen as a “marker of prestige.” As the PC toppled the encyclopedia as the “purchasable ‘edge’ for over-anxious parents,” the bundle fell apart and the value proposition no longer made sense for most of the market.</p>

<p>Far from being <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/03/14/encyclopedias-are-like-journalism-its-better-when-they-are-open/">the inevitable victory of open over closed</a> then, Britannica’s announcement represents the complex result of values decoupled. This story is especially important for independent bookstores and public libraries to understand; they are subject to the same forces.</p>

<p>A little over two years ago, Clay Shirky wrote a great essay about <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/11/local-bookstores-social-hubs-and-mutualization/">local bookstores as a social hub</a> that speaks to this problem. In both cases, sales numbers are easily measured and easy to fixate on, but they are secondary to factors that are much less easily measured. For Britannica consumers, there’s the value of owning a 32-volume printed encyclopedia. That value might just not exist anymore; if that’s true, they’ve made the right decision to move away from a printed edition. (It’s probably true. According to <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/after-244-years-encyclopaedia-britannica-stops-the-presses/">the New York Times article about the announcement</a>, less than 1% of Britannica’s revenue was coming from print sales.)</p>

<p>But there are still many compelling arguments for the side-effect values of a bookstore or library as an inviting physical space dedicated to the exchange of information, even as communities and their information consumption preferences change. Keeping the bookstore’s ability to deliver these values coupled with the sale of paper books would be a mistake.</p>

<p>Institutions like bookstores and libraries (and newspapers, record labels, movie studios, etc.) are all dealing to a greater or lesser extent with the problem of bundle failure. That is to say: they can no longer count on subsidizing the real value they deliver with more monetizable ancillary functions. Instead, they have to take a critical look at what people value about them and figure out how to charge for it.</p>

<p>I’m sure it was a hard decision after a quarter millennium of print, but Britannica made the right move jettisoning a product that people weren’t interested in to focus on the one that they were. I really want bookstores and libraries to continue to succeed in the years to come, in no small part because I value the products and services they provide that I can’t directly pay for. I hope they can do the introspection to separate their core values from their most easily-measured ones in order to make the difficult decisions to make it work.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bookstores" /><category term="britannica" /><category term="clay shirky" /><category term="libraries" /><category term="tim carmody" /><category term="wikipedia" /><category term="wired" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tim Carmody’s Wired opinion piece about Wikipedia, Windows, and the Britannica is the best piece of commentary to come out of the vaunted encyclopedia’s announcement this week that they’re discontinuing their print edition to focus on their online product.]]></summary></entry></feed>
