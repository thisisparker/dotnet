One is a fare token, which I’ve been thinking about as it relates to public transit and locational privacy. Another is a currency token, which has come up in the last few weeks as I’m reading <cite>Debt</cite> by David Graeber. Obviously there’s some overlap there, but thinking about the ways in which they differ has been really interesting, and there’s enough weird history of each to fill a Thomas Pynchon novel.</p>

<p>Fare tokens are intriguing as artifacts of a transit system, which are pretty much always interesting to me. Like system maps, which I’ve also <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2010/12/metro-maps-kindle-screensaver/">thought about a bit</a>, fare tokens are necessarily unique to one place and provide a physical history of that system’s character and aesthetic. They’re also ephemeral, anonymous, and completely commoditized. There’s some sort of paradox there: something inherently interesting about objects that are so non-descript. (Rick Prelinger put it well in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/technology/internet-archives-repository-collects-thousands-of-books.html?pagewanted=all">story in the New York Times this weekend</a>: “As time passes, the works we tried to junk often prove more interesting than the ones we chose to save.”)</p>

<p>As a privacy-preserving technology, fare tokens are great. Entrance into a public transit system should be a question of authorization: are you permitted to do what you’re trying to do? The answer to that should only be contingent on whether or not you’ve paid the fare, which is a piece of data the token can communicate just fine. Too often, though, fare systems first ask who you are. Swiping (or tapping) a fare card gives the system an identifier, which it runs against a database to see whether that identifier is tied to a paid fare. There are tempting reasons to go with the latter scheme — a lost card can be replaced because the value is recorded, and the system can gather and use data about riding patterns in order to target improvements — but there’s a trade-off with rider privacy.</p>

<p>(To my mind, the trade-off is akin to that between database loyalty programs, like Target’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all">recently documented “Guest ID” system</a> and punch-card loyalty programs. Both provide rewards to return customers, but one is more privacy-friendly and generates less monetizable data.)</p>

<p>Of course, another issue with letting customers carry around the authorization information in their own token is that it depends on the issuer’s ability to reliably generate and verify their own tokens. One interesting anecdote I found out about this weekend was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway#Token_War_with_Connecticut">New York City “Token War”</a> with Connecticut. Tokens for Connecticut Turnpike tolls were the same size and shape as NYC subway fares but cost much less, which led to Connecticut Turnpike tokens ending up in NYCTA collection boxes. Connecticut promised to change the shape of their tokens, but failed to do so for years. I’m not sure how it ended: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway#cite_note-token_war-63">one NY Times article</a> cited on the issue’s Wikipedia page but unavailable online suggests it happened when Connecticut discontinued their toll charges and paid the NYCTA for all the collected tokens; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/04/opinion/no-need-for-a-new-token-war.html">another article available online</a> says it ended when the NYCTA rewired their turnstiles.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you’ve got currency tokens, which make up the field of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exonumia">exonumia</a>“. These tokens are like coins, but issued by somebody other than the government. Sometimes these tokens really take off, as in the case of the Strachan and Co Trade Tokens that were <a href="http://www.tokencoins.com/main.htm">South Africa’s first circulating indigenous currency</a>. ((It’s not often that Wikipedia disappoints, but I can’t find any real information there about these coins. Instead, there’s a charmingly Web 1.0 site, which I really like.))</p>

<p>In the US, there were a series of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_times_token">hard-times tokens</a>” which circulated as currency between about 1833 and 1843, and were only officially outlawed in 1857. One of the most prominent examples was the endearingly named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuchtwanger_Cent">Feuchtwanger cent</a>, which is now pretty collectible by exonumismatists. Lewis Feuchtwanger’s story is interesting for his persistence in minting these coins and his attempts to get them recognized officially. His appeals to Congress give the story a <cite>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</cite> vibe — a film whose plot also turns on a coin, albeit a tossed one.</p>

<p>In any case, the parallels between these hard-times tokens and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin seem straightforward, but they’re not ones I’ve seen pointed out elsewhere. Bitcoin’s got <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/golden-cyberfetters/">some</a> <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/38392/">problems</a>, but supporters who’ve read <cite>Cryptonomicon</cite> are quick to point out the benefits: things like anonymous transactions, the ground-up minting and lack of reliance on a centralized nation-state, and the security of the currency against counterfeiting. These are laudable goals, and maybe last delivered on in the hard times era. Lewis Feuchtwanger would be proud.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="location" /><category term="money" /><category term="privacy" /><category term="public transit" /><category term="tokens" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been thinking a lot about two different kinds of tokens lately.

Participants “check in” while boarding, and confirm their location either through continuous GPS data directly from their phones, or by scanning a QR code at the end points of their trip.</p>

<p>From a privacy perspective, this system stands in stark contrast to the current standard procedure in Berlin. As with nearly all German municipal rail, Berlin subways and buses operate on a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Proof-of-payment">proof-of-payment system</a>: tickets are required while on board, but are only very occasionally checked.</p>

<p>Apparently, such proof-of-payment systems rose to popularity because of German labor shortages in the 1960s, but they also happen to be extremely respectful of rider privacy ((You can imagine that the labor shortages, and the subsequent manpower restrictions might have served as a constraint that influenced the design of public transportation systems in the same way that Jonathan Zittrain says a lack of financial resources influenced the early design of the Internet (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKmtmhrfMps&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=817s">See him explain that at Harvard</a>) )). Because travel and location data is never even collected, there’s no chance of it being cross-referenced against other data sets, given to the government, or sold to corporations. Though tickets may be traced to a buyer’s credit card, their actual use is not tracked, and riders may also pay cash with no penalty, preserving anonymity.</p>

<p>Berlin’s recently launched pilot program has none of these advantages. First, there’s the issue of anonymity: even taking the BVG and Deutsche Bahn at face value that the user data will be “scrubbed” and saved anonymously for only six months — a dubious proposition given the tempting law enforcement and ridership research opportunities of slipping from that stance — there is a huge and growing body of scholarship covering the possibilities of de-anonymizing large data sets. <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD1F3FF93AA3575BC0A9609C8B63">AOL search queries</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/netflix-faq.html">Netflix movie ratings</a>, even <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/census.html">US Census data</a> have effectively received the de-anonymization treatment.</p>

<p>There’s also the general question of locational privacy: individuals should have the <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy">“ability to move in public space with the expectation that … their location will not be systematically” recorded</a>. That definition is at odds with the premise of the Touch&amp;Travel program, which is basically consent to systematic tracking in exchange for a more convenient ticket purchase process.</p>

<p>Obviously that convenience is nice, and you only need to experience once the feeling of seeing your train pull away while you’re waiting for your ticket to print to understand the temptation of such a trade. And it’s true that there are occasionally positive outcomes of large-scale surveillance programs — New York City’s MetroCard data has been used in both <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/nyregion/19metrocard.html?pagewanted=all">legitimate alibis and criminal convictions</a>, and even critics acknowledge that there are <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-big-question-are-cctv-cameras-a-waste-of-money-in-the-fight-against-crime-822079.html">a small number of crimes that London’s CCTV system has helped solve</a>. I won’t argue that there are no advantages to such a system, but that they’re outweighed by more subtle and incremental disadvantages. The loss of privacy and anonymity carries a real cost, even if it’s not one that’s immediately tangible.</p>

<p>Berlin’s public transportation system is currently one of the best imaginable in terms of privacy, and implementing a system that strips those benefits away is irresponsible and short-sighted. Further, privacy is a hard thing to introduce into a developed system; Berlin should reject any new solution that doesn’t make adequate consideration of privacy in its basic design, even if it’s a promised eventual addition.</p>

<p>Being mindful of privacy doesn’t require foregoing an update to ticket-buying infrastructure, either. There are <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Digital_credential#Anonymous_digital_credentials_and_pseudonyms">cryptographic techniques for validating credentials anonymously</a> that, while complex and occasionally difficult to understand, can be used to address the current pain points while still preserving privacy and anonymity. A system built with those techniques might not be as straightforward to develop and deploy, but would be invaluable to the people living in and visiting Berlin, and as a model to transportation agencies all over the world.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="berlin" /><category term="germany" /><category term="location" /><category term="privacy" /><category term="public transit" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[NPR Berlin reported today that Berlin’s public transportation authority, the BVG, launched the Touch&amp;Travel program [de] earlier this month, which allows Vodafone and Telekom customers to use an Android phone or an iPhone to pay for their transport tickets.
