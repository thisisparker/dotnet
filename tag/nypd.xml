<p>I <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160214/11494733601/nypd-says-it-has-no-record-asking-disney-to-use-copyright-to-shut-down-times-square-characters-despite-public-admission.shtml">wrote the whole thing up for Techdirt</a> this week:</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the nature of frustrated transparency efforts is that we don’t really have the answers. If the NYPD had promptly responded that it had no such records or would be withholding them according to a particular exemption, or even if it had given me a limited set, we could close this case. As it stands, we don’t really know anything more about the NYPD’s bizarre efforts to jam its “quality-of-life” issues into an ill-fitting copyright enforcement box.</p>
