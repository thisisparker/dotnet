That has some implications for ligatures, but that’s beyond the scope of this post and my knowledge.</p>

<p>However, most of the Fraktur alphabet is available <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/1D5.html">deep in the math characters</a> code points. Using a simple conversion tool, like <a href="http://www.panix.com/~eli/unicode/convert.cgi">this text converter</a> I keep bookmarked, you can replace standard characters with those math symbols that resemble them. By doing that, you can copy and paste what looks like formatted text into plain text boxes, and—for example—make jokes with it on Twitter.</p>

<p>Which raises the question of how various platforms support it, and how that support degrades. After all, we’re talking about pretty deep recesses of the Unicode character space, so it can vary pretty wildly.</p>

<p>Earlier tonight I made a <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/567543759479373824">joke on Twitter</a> to my friend Noah that used these characters. Here’s how it appeared on my OS X box running Firefox:</p>

<p>But here’s how it looked to him on his iPhone:</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/noahscreenshot.png" alt="noahscreenshot" /></p>

<p>I wanted to see how it appears on different platforms, so I <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/567545787127578624">asked people to send me screenshots</a>, and got a whole bunch of responses. On multiple versions of Windows and different platforms, you get empty boxes:</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/B-BUhcGIUAA7TWZ.png" alt="B-BUhcGIUAA7TWZ" /></p>

<p>While on Android, across many different apps, it degrades to the plain latin text!</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/androidscreenshot.png" alt="androidscreenshot" /></p>

<p>I also got evidence that it worked fine on a range of GNU/Linux boxes, every OS X combination I saw, and a Chromebook.</p>

<p>The frustrating result is that not only can you not count on all popular platforms to support these characters, you also can’t count on them to fail the same way. Android removes the context that these are “special” characters, while iOS, Windows, (and, incidentally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS">Sailfish OS</a>) render it completely unreadable.</p>

<p>So I guess don’t use it for mission-critical Twitter jokes.</p>

<p>P.S.

And while the whole thing’s a bit tongue-in-cheek, he’s actually right about some of the benefits that so-called “copycats” offer; they are in a position to make marginal changes and improvements that “original” start-ups might be hesitant about, from small feature improvements to big things like internationalization.</p>

<p>In the last year in Berlin, the tone used to discuss copycats <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/blog/2011/08/09/founders-stand-up-the-anti-copycat-revolution-starts-now/">has become too aggressive</a>. I’m all for celebrating creativity and innovation, but it shouldn’t take the form of denigrating the “copycats”. It doesn’t make sense to dismiss a company, or a whole swath of companies, because their influences are showing.</p>

<p>That said, there is a “right way” to incorporate those influences, and there’s a way that people think is sleazy. Peter is one of the founders of <a href="http://conference.cognitivecities.com/">Cognitive Cities</a>, a beautifully orchestrated and executed set of events celebrating the emergent intelligence in cities, which recently had its name and <a href="http://yourneighbours.de/writings/under-the-hood-of-the-cognitive-cities-conference/">logo</a> copied wholesale by an American/Swiss <a href="http://cognitive-cities.org/wiki/Main_Page">research project</a>.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the ideas of others in the field, incorporating and building upon them, should not be discouraged. But implying an endorsement, or hoping to create and cash in on confusion of users is a different thing. It’s a good idea to recognize that difference.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="berlin" /><category term="germany" /><category term="peter bihr" /><category term="plagiarism" /><category term="start-ups" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on his personal blog, my buddy Peter Bihr has come to the defense of that most reviled breed of start-up — the German copycat.

Participants “check in” while boarding, and confirm their location either through continuous GPS data directly from their phones, or by scanning a QR code at the end points of their trip.</p>

<p>From a privacy perspective, this system stands in stark contrast to the current standard procedure in Berlin. As with nearly all German municipal rail, Berlin subways and buses operate on a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Proof-of-payment">proof-of-payment system</a>: tickets are required while on board, but are only very occasionally checked.</p>

<p>Apparently, such proof-of-payment systems rose to popularity because of German labor shortages in the 1960s, but they also happen to be extremely respectful of rider privacy ((You can imagine that the labor shortages, and the subsequent manpower restrictions might have served as a constraint that influenced the design of public transportation systems in the same way that Jonathan Zittrain says a lack of financial resources influenced the early design of the Internet (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKmtmhrfMps&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=817s">See him explain that at Harvard</a>) )). Because travel and location data is never even collected, there’s no chance of it being cross-referenced against other data sets, given to the government, or sold to corporations. Though tickets may be traced to a buyer’s credit card, their actual use is not tracked, and riders may also pay cash with no penalty, preserving anonymity.</p>

<p>Berlin’s recently launched pilot program has none of these advantages. First, there’s the issue of anonymity: even taking the BVG and Deutsche Bahn at face value that the user data will be “scrubbed” and saved anonymously for only six months — a dubious proposition given the tempting law enforcement and ridership research opportunities of slipping from that stance — there is a huge and growing body of scholarship covering the possibilities of de-anonymizing large data sets. <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD1F3FF93AA3575BC0A9609C8B63">AOL search queries</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/netflix-faq.html">Netflix movie ratings</a>, even <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/census.html">US Census data</a> have effectively received the de-anonymization treatment.</p>

<p>There’s also the general question of locational privacy: individuals should have the <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy">“ability to move in public space with the expectation that … their location will not be systematically” recorded</a>. That definition is at odds with the premise of the Touch&amp;Travel program, which is basically consent to systematic tracking in exchange for a more convenient ticket purchase process.</p>

<p>Obviously that convenience is nice, and you only need to experience once the feeling of seeing your train pull away while you’re waiting for your ticket to print to understand the temptation of such a trade. And it’s true that there are occasionally positive outcomes of large-scale surveillance programs — New York City’s MetroCard data has been used in both <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/nyregion/19metrocard.html?pagewanted=all">legitimate alibis and criminal convictions</a>, and even critics acknowledge that there are <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-big-question-are-cctv-cameras-a-waste-of-money-in-the-fight-against-crime-822079.html">a small number of crimes that London’s CCTV system has helped solve</a>. I won’t argue that there are no advantages to such a system, but that they’re outweighed by more subtle and incremental disadvantages. The loss of privacy and anonymity carries a real cost, even if it’s not one that’s immediately tangible.</p>

<p>Berlin’s public transportation system is currently one of the best imaginable in terms of privacy, and implementing a system that strips those benefits away is irresponsible and short-sighted. Further, privacy is a hard thing to introduce into a developed system; Berlin should reject any new solution that doesn’t make adequate consideration of privacy in its basic design, even if it’s a promised eventual addition.</p>

<p>Being mindful of privacy doesn’t require foregoing an update to ticket-buying infrastructure, either. There are <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Digital_credential#Anonymous_digital_credentials_and_pseudonyms">cryptographic techniques for validating credentials anonymously</a> that, while complex and occasionally difficult to understand, can be used to address the current pain points while still preserving privacy and anonymity. A system built with those techniques might not be as straightforward to develop and deploy, but would be invaluable to the people living in and visiting Berlin, and as a model to transportation agencies all over the world.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="berlin" /><category term="germany" /><category term="location" /><category term="privacy" /><category term="public transit" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[NPR Berlin reported today that Berlin’s public transportation authority, the BVG, launched the Touch&amp;Travel program [de] earlier this month, which allows Vodafone and Telekom customers to use an Android phone or an iPhone to pay for their transport tickets.
