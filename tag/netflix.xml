<blockquote>
  <p>It should be astonishing that a company that once had to maintain and transport a staggering inventory of fragile plastic discs is able to offer <em>less</em> when its marginal cost dropped to near zero.</p>

  <p>The problem is that, unlike earlier movie-rental options, streaming rights fall fundamentally within a permission culture. Netflix is a great illustration of what’s gone wrong here. It’s gone from having a nearly unrivaled catalog of films available to rent to being <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/netflix-instant-thinking-about-adding-good-movie,34958/">the butt of Onion jokes</a>. What happened: It shifted from a system where nobody had a veto power over its operations, to one where it had to get permission and make deals with Hollywood. Sometimes it’s difficult to find the concrete costs of living in a permission culture, but the decline of Netflix’s selection is an important cautionary tale.</p>
