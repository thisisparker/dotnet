His publisher said: well, if Twain wrote it, we own it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the more firmly they insisted Twain himself was behind the work, the more they strengthened the Twain estate’s copyright argument that it, as the owner of all things written by Twain, owned this book, too. And Twain had a deal with Harper &amp; Brothers that gave it the sole rights to publish books by Twain, so Hutchings and her publisher would have to produce credible evidence that he wanted to break that deal in his afterlife.</p>

<p>They just don’t make them like this any more.

<p>I moved a month ago, September 1, to a new corner in San Francisco. In two years here, I’ve lived in the Mission, in Noe Valley, in Bernal Heights, in Pacific Heights, and now in Hayes Valley. The picture above is my corner, as photographed by the Google Street View car in April 2011.</p>

<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://www.oldsf.org/#">OldSF</a>, here’s a photo of the same corner (same angle!) from 1929:</p>

<p>Look at the stairs, across the street on the left side, and how they match with the current construction. And across the street on the right, the building now obscured by a tree but just the same.</p>

<p>Even more exciting to me, from the same site, is the photo from a year earlier, in 1928:</p>

<p>A horse, right there on the street! And look, on this side of the street, on the left, the building is under construction.</p>

<p>San Francisco’s got a lot of interesting history for a relatively new place. It’s nice to feel like I’m part of it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="google" /><category term="history" /><category term="san francisco" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
