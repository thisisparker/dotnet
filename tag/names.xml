To that end, I’ve been toying around with the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">Social Security Administration’s baby name dataset</a>, which records the number of babies born with each given name every year, both federally and at the state level. Because I’ve also been watching <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> along with the <a href="http://foreverdogproductions.com/fdpn/podcasts/treks-and-the-city/">Treks And The City podcast</a>, I chose to dig into information about the name “Wesley.”</p>

<p>On my first pass through the data I noticed that the name’s popularity dramatically spiked around 1976, and then tapered off for a few decades after. Honestly, that spike is the most interesting property of the whole graph, and I can’t explain it very well. But a funny secondary effect is that neither <em>TNG</em>‘s premiere nor the release of <em>The Princess Bride</em>—both in 1987—could prop up the name as it declined in popularity. The effect makes it look like it’s tumbling off a cliff, instead of regressing to the mean. This graph, including the label, was generated in Python’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matplotlib</code>.</p>

<p>After looking at the federal data, I decided to dig into the state-level stuff, to give me a (long-anticipated!) opportunity to generate a choropleth map. Again, I cleaned up the data in Python, and then generated a map using a Javascript library called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href="https://d3-geomap.github.io/"&gt;d3-geomap&lt;/a&gt;</code>. For a long time I’ve wanted to get more familiar with its parent library, d3, and this has been a nice opportunity to dip my toe into that.</p>

This problem disproportionately affects women, and it’s not just a few cases. What is the scale of people who may be affected?</p>

<p>Using data from the Social Security Administration about birth names and death rates, I estimate that there are 10,620 living people designated female at birth named Isis in the US. ((There is no comparable data for people designated male at birth because the name has not been common enough to be reported.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all people designated female at birth are women, and not all women are designated female at birth. Further, not all people with the name Isis will have it at birth, and not all people born with it will have it as a name now. This is a major limitation of the data. I’ve tried to be as precise as possible throughout this post, but please feel free to suggest corrections.)) The <a href="https://gist.github.com/thisisparker/5f1e9cc4e7ae5687a6a3">full data is available on Github</a>.</p>

<p>According to SSA, <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/rankchange.html">the name “Isis” has been in the top 1000 since 1994</a> for people designated female at birth in the US. It peaked in 2005, with 561 new social security card applications in that year.</p>

<p>SSA only makes information on <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html">names outside of the top 1000</a> available as raw data, not through its “explorer.” I downloaded it and pulled the number of Isis births into one document. That would be sufficient to calculate (roughly) the number of people born with the name Isis, but wouldn’t account for how many of these people may no longer be living.</p>

<p>In order to determine that number, I went to another data set from SSA: the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">Actuarial Life Table</a>. ((Thanks for the link, <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsaTararrel/status/668130752270348289">Alex</a>!)) That dataset includes the percentage of living people at each given age, as of 2011. I fudged the numbers forward, and treated is as if it were 2014 data.</p>

<p>That was the most complex component of the estimation, and it turned out to be mostly unnecessary. The name Isis did not appear to be given to even five babies designated male or female at birth in a single year between 1901 and 1960, ((Though: Social Security card applications were much less common before 1937, so some births may be excluded)) so nearly all US-born people named Isis are under 55 years old and are still alive.</p>

<p>Put in concrete terms: of the estimated 10,715 people in the US named Isis at birth, only about 95 are deceased.</p>

<p>There are serious limitations to this estimation. Among them: it doesn’t account for people born outside of the United States or who did not apply for Social Security cards. The survivorship calculation assumes that the name is evenly distributed across demographics, which is probably not true. It depends on SSA’s treatment of gender as an unchanging binary, which is incorrect. Still, it does provide some insight into the number of people affected by heavy-handed efforts by social media platforms and others to filter out <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/11/14/9734894/daesh-isis-isil">content related to Daesh</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="isis" /><category term="names" /><category term="new york times" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times has reported that, despite the long-standing traditional meaning of the name, people named Isis have faced issues ranging from inconveniences to major discrimination in the past several years on the basis of their name.
