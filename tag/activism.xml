His journalism 25 years ago played a major role in bringing climate change into the public’s attention, and his work with his organization 350.org has moved opposition to the Keystone pipeline to a prominent position.</p>

<p>I found much of the interview to be inspiring, but I thought a metaphor he used in the response to the first question was especially salient:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone believed, 25 years ago — at least I did — that people would see there’s a problem. That if scientists and the rest of us really explained to policy leaders what was going on in the world, then they would take care of the problem. …</p>

  <p>…But at a certain point it just began to dawn on us, or many of us, that it wasn’t working. And really the reason it wasn’t working was the incredible power of the fossil fuel industry, based in wealth. They presented an almost insurmountable obstacle, and we certainly were never going to outspend them. So the hunt was on for the other currencies we might work in. The only ones that anyone could think of was currencies of movements: numbers, passion, spirit, creativity, occasionally spending one’s bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From an activist perspective, it’s very interesting to see somebody talk about these tactics as currencies, and to put them in the same strategic collection as things like journalism or research. That’s true for environmentalism, but I think it’s also true for the issues I work on, like copyright reform and privacy.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get into a familiar rhythm that produces measurable successes, but that doesn’t always move you towards real victories. Investing energy in just one “currency” means you won’t be as effective as you can be, and sometimes you won’t be effective at all. The narratives of change in some areas look very different from others.</p>

<p>Even just within the activism space, it’s important to diversify. When it comes to domestic policy, people in DC often push the opinion that DC is the only place where change can happen. But that’s just not true. Change happens when engineers write code, when lawyers file suits, when journalists tell stories, when whistleblowers leak secrets, when people get informed, and in so many different ways. Different efforts require different balances of these currencies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/09/16/130916fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all">A New Yorker article on anti-Keystone activism</a> describes some of the different camps that emerged at a recent summit about the movement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The group broke into three camps. The participants from Silicon Valley were deeply influenced by how activists in the Arab Spring had used cell phones, text messages, and social media to organize. “They talked about liberation technology, and how that could be used and deployed around this movement and this issue, particularly given how strongly young people feel,” one of Steyer’s aides said. … Podesta, who was skeptical, described them as the “all we need is the killer app” camp.</p>

  <p>McKibben represented the second faction, which Podesta described as a “human-rights kind of strategy.” McKibben talked about civil disobedience, of the sort that he and his followers engaged in, and about his latest effort, a campaign modelled on the anti-apartheid divestment movement. He believes that major institutions can be pressured to divest themselves of fossil fuels. He is at work enlisting what he says are huge numbers of young people—his organization has thousands of volunteers—including an extensive network on college campuses.</p>

  <p>Podesta and Lehane argued that, to change policy, one had to change the politics. They cited immigration reform and gay marriage, issues on which national politics had changed quickly in the Democrats’ favor. “Right now, there’s no pain in being a weasel on climate change,” Podesta said. “What’s the safest political thing to do? Don’t piss off the fossil-fuel industry, because they’ll come after you if you do. And then the other group is ‘Say the right thing, but don’t do much.’ ” Republicans have been able to claim that the science is unclear and that there hasn’t been appreciable warming in the past ten years and not “pay any price for it.” Podesta and Lehane urged Steyer to spend his money on electoral politics, to force politicians to pay a price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/01/will-last-weeks-blackouts-reframe-the-conversation-on-copyright-policy/">protests against SOPA</a> were historic and exciting, and for a year after — it’s slowed down now — people were asking how to get that kind of action behind their own cause. The answer I gave was that you just can’t generate that at random; a lot of different things have to come together. But a better answer might have been: the narrative of SOPA won’t, and basically can’t, be the one that works for you. An effective strategy of change requires a diversity of tactics.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="350" /><category term="activism" /><category term="bill mckibben" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="environmentalism" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Salon has run an interview with Bill McKibben, a longtime journalist and environmental activist.

Imagine: online protests and the resulting media coverage and legislator calls led to the shelving of two “sure thing” bills over the course of two days.</p>

<p>But the protests shouldn’t just be considered in that narrow a frame. As <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/20/struggle-against-sopa-and-pipa-is-not-over">Dan Gillmor</a> and <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/01/20/the-next-sopa">Marco Arment</a> correctly point out, any victory against specific legislation in this field is bound to be ephemeral. The entertainment lobbying groups aren’t going to rest in drafting new laws to slip by under the public notice.</p>

<p>So the question becomes: were the online protests effective on any scale beyond the legislation at hand? I think the answer to that is yes. For one thing, these online protests brought copyright policy to the public attention, and that’s almost always a good thing. The moment at this week’s South Carolina GOP primary debate where <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/01/20/republican-candidates-talk-sopa/">all four candidates came out strongly against SOPA and PIPA</a> felt unprecedented in the copyright world. In a field where “<a href="http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-2.html">common sense revolts</a>” at the industry-penned laws that are on the books, public attention is a real first step to reform.</p>

<p>Another change that I hope persists is the way that contested facts are being framed. One of the frustrating things about statements against the bills has been the formula they all seem to follow: we all agree that piracy is a major problem, but these bills are the wrong way to address them. Joshua McVeigh-Schultz at USC has done <a href="http://culturedigitally.org/2012/01/sopa-and-the-framing-of-contested-facts">some good writing on this phenomenon</a>.</p>

<p>Until the last few days, people who were questioning the premise, by suggesting that maybe piracy isn’t a serious economic problem, were on the fringe. Rick Falkvinge of the Pirate Party opposed the statements on the grounds that we need to “<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120102/16374417254/it-is-time-to-stop-pretending-to-endorse-copyright-monopoly.shtml">stop pretending to endorse the copyright monopoly</a>“. Tim O’Reilly has been persistent and eloquent in <a href="https://plus.google.com/107033731246200681024/posts/BEDukdz2B1r">questioning the economic harm of piracy</a>. And of course Julian Sanchez’s <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/how-copyright-industries-con-congress/">spot-on analysis for the Cato Institute</a> has consistently called the MPAA et al out on their funny numbers.</p>

<p>But in the past few days, I think we’re starting to see this discussion creep into the mainstream — or at least from the “copyright nerd” to the “general nerd” arena. Not only have musician <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2012/01/21/megaupload/">Jonathan Coulton</a> and actor <a href="http://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/16246156406/mpaa-directly-publicly-threatens-politicians-who">Wil Wheaton</a> (admittedly, both nerd icons) come out with statements that piracy is not the issue, but sites like <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/21/does-online-piracy-hurt-the-economy-a-look-at-the-numbers/">Forbes</a> and <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/01/12/how-much-do-music-and-movie-piracy-really-hurt-the-u-s-economy/">Freakonomics</a> have picked up the question as well.</p>

<p>Detractors of the Occupy movement complain that those protesters’ issues were too nebulous. Without specific demands they couldn’t expect to effect change. In the short term, it’s true that they couldn’t claim the legislative victory that this round of protests have. But the Occupy protests were absolutely able to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/occupy-wall-street-media_b_1069250.html">change the conversation</a>. As Alexis Madrigal describes in the Atlantic this week, the Occupy protests <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/the-sopa-blackout-created-a-big-problem/251578/">created a problem</a> in the particular set of “foregrounding” a set of issues into something that should be addressed. Madrigal is skeptical that the anti-SOPA efforts will be able to bridge from specific to general, but I remain hopeful.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s important to consider how this week’s actions have changed the face of online protest. Anil Dash has taken <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/01/the-history-and-future-of-web-protest.html">a good look at the history and future of online protest</a>, with thoughts about how it might develop. I’m encouraged by the Reddit front page lighting up with stories about ACTA, and Hacker News discussing anew the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs9.html">YCRFS 9 proposal to kill Hollywood</a>. There’s energy in the air, and it’s being directed in the right place. Hopefully now we can look at ways to proactively shape copyright policy in a way that benefits the public, instead of reacting to bad legislation one after another.</p>

<p>There are a lot of places to reform copyright. Joel Spolsky has <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117114202722218150209/posts/4GgaRiSyaTf">put together a good list of them</a>, if you’re interested. We can’t know yet, but I hope to look back on the events of this week as a starting point for big changes.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="activism" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="pipa" /><category term="sopa" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This online blackouts last week were not only the largest in recent history, but in a narrow sense, they might be the most effective ever.
