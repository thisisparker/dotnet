And while I really enjoyed the book, I was disappointed by the lonely protagonist’s occasional sexist comments, which were unnecessary, a little cheap, and (one hopes) out of place in an era where humans are making repeat visits to Mars.</p>

<p><em>Note: This post is mostly spoiler-free, unless you have no idea what the book is about at all and want to preserve that complete innocence. Basically, everything in here is the background you’d get in the one sentence synopsis: Mark Watney gets left for dead on Mars and he and NASA spend the book trying to figure out how to get him back.</em></p>

<p>What sorts of comments caught my attention? Among others: at one point he disparages a committee conducting an investigation by telling another NASA employee that “each and every one of their mothers is a prostitute.” He refers to his mission’s chief computer scientist as “a hot chick who went to Mars.” Perhaps worst, he uses the word “rape” to describe intrusive modifications he had to make to a spacecraft.</p>

<p>That sucks. It sucks because it’s a distraction from the gripping story, because it makes Watney seem like more of an insensitive oaf than a likable smart-ass, and because it suggests a cynicism about science work remaining uninviting.</p>

<p>But mostly, it sucks because <em>The Martian</em> is an engaging story of space exploration that could spark a desire in young people to pursue interests in STEM. Unfortunately, these offhand remarks also sends the message that half of those young readers will be less welcome if they do so.</p>

<p>And for a novel so widely praised for its ingenuity and attention to detail, it seems like a weird example of lazy character development. An interview response from author Andy Weir doesn’t do much to assuage that concern:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a really easy book to write; I just had him say what I would say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <em>The Martian</em> was self-published in 2011—and even when it was released by a publisher in early 2014—these concerns may have been off people’s radar. A lot of that changed in late 2014, when the excellent Rose Eveleth ((Did you read her article on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/futurism-sexism-men/400097/">futurism’s lack of women</a>? Go do that, I’ll wait.)) started a global conversation about women in STEM when she called out the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/13/7213819/your-bowling-shirt-is-holding-back-progress">inappropriate sexist shirt one scientist wore</a> to celebrate landing a spacecraft on a comet.</p>

<p>Matt Taylor’s shirt wasn’t intended to send any larger message, just as Mark Watney’s comments are surely “just a joke.” And it’s true, that scientist’s shirt doesn’t define him any more than a few lines of dialogue define a character over the course of 370 pages. But in both cases, it projects an air of hostility and unwelcomeness to women in a field that has historically excluded them.</p>

<p>I hope this is an arena where we’re making progress. I hope the issues that Eveleth highlighted are getting better—and I hope they’re getting better fast enough that the real 17th person on Mars doesn’t think in sexist terms about his colleagues and crew. In that optimistic worldview, Watney’s comments feel weirdly anachronistic.</p>

<p>But there’s also a degree of self-fulfilling prophecy, and this kind of dialogue from a generally likable character doesn’t help the cause. With <em>The Martian</em> as a best-seller, and its movie adaptation coming out later this year, it is one of the most prominent public representations of space exploration out there right now. It’s disappointing that, despite placing women in powerful mission roles, it perpetuates stereotypes of misogyny and sexism in space.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="andy weir" /><category term="feminism" /><category term="mars" /><category term="nasa" /><category term="the martian" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though The Martian was only officially released last year, I felt like it sat in my to-read pile for way too long before I finally got to it this week.

It would continue a tradition of unrestricted space photos that began with NASA’s images—necessarily public domain, coming from a U.S. government agency—but which is <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/when-spacex-takes-photos-on-a-nasa-mission-copyright-law-explodes">jeopardized when space photographs come from private companies</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/599px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17-300x300.jpg" alt="599px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17" />This is an issue I’ve been vocal about before, and with other contract photographers that NASA uses. (Like for example: it strikes me as just impossibly sad that none of the photos of the retiring shuttle being flown over the US—take <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/7088014787/">this beautiful shot over D.C.</a>, to pick just one—likely won’t be in the public domain for another century.)</p>

<p>A robust and well-documented space program is a major boon for motivating young people to study science. Images from space have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble#cite_note-NASAmarble-2">formed the basis of major social movements</a>, and been the <a href="http://sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/WholeEarth_buton.html">target of activism campaigns</a>.</p>

<p>And just generally, it’s an incredibly valuable thing that U.S. government works go straight to the public domain. Lots of other countries don’t have that, despite the common-sense logic behind it: we, the taxpayers, already paid for the work, which requires no additional incentive to be produced. To see that value get chipped away by private deals would be tragic.</p>

<p>All this is to say, society has gotten so much out of media from space being free for all to share, and that shouldn’t end as private companies get access. Please, Elon Musk, commit to releasing photography from SpaceX into the public domain. The future will thank you.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="elon musk" /><category term="nasa" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="spacex" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It probably goes without saying that I am a strong supporter of Techdirt’s call for Elon Musk to release space photos taken by SpaceX into the public domain.

This is a good update, and parallels earlier language that allowed contractors to request to retain their copyright to use in commercial software projects—obviously more choice for free software is nice.</p>

<p>Here’s the language of the proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[1827.404-4(b)](2) The contracting officer may […] grant the contractor permission to assert claim to copyright, publish, or release to others computer software first produced in the performance of a contract if:</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>(ii) The contractor has identified an existing open source software project or proposes a new one and states a positive intention of incorporating identified computer software first produced under the contract into that project, or has been instructed by the Agency to incorporate software first produced under the contract into an open source software project or otherwise release the software as open source software;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, in the absence of such a provision, NASA could get assigned the copyright and choose to release it into the public domain or under a free license itself. But a developer interested in continuing work on the project would probably do a better job, so it’s good to see they now can request the right to do so.</p>

<p>This proposal is <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/09/24/2014-21476/supplement-regulatory-review-no-2-federal-acquisition-regulations">open for comments for the next 60 days</a>, in case anybody is interested in weighing in.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="free software" /><category term="nasa" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[NASA just submitted a proposed update to its acquisition regulations, specifying that contracting software developers may request to retain their copyright in order to release their software as part of a free software project.
