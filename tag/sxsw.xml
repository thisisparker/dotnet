I really hope one of them gets picked. The PanelPicker is currently open for voting (I’d appreciate your votes!) and then I’ll know later this year if I’m in.</p>

<p><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4022">Ebooks: A Coming War for the Soul of the Library</a> will be with my friends Audrey Evans and Nancy Sims (<a href="https://twitter.com/copyrightlibn">@CopyrightLibn</a>) and cover the issues libraries face as publishers push for an ebook licensing model to replace the current <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#108">108</a> and first sale regime.

<p>The second panel proposal is called <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/6458">Drones Gone Wild</a>, and will be with my colleague Trevor, as well as <a href="http://twitter.com/rcalo">Ryan Calo</a> and Nabiha Syed, who’s currently a First Amendment Fellow for the New York Times and who has been instrumental in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/eff-and-muckrock-partner-see-how-your-local-police-are-using-drones">the EFF/MuckRock drone request campaign</a>. (Trevor and I previously <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/07/pwn-the-drones-presentation-at-hope/">spoke together about drones at HOPE</a> and we co-operate <a href="https://twitter.com/drones">@drones</a>.) We’ll be talking about the rise of domestic drones and the privacy problems they introduce.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="drones" /><category term="e-books" /><category term="EFF" /><category term="privacy" /><category term="sxsw" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve submitted two proposals for panels at next year’s South by Southwest festival in Austin.
