I had long heard the urban legend explanation that the arrangement was deliberately designed to slow down a population trained to quickly enter strings of numbers on calculators and cash registers and prevent them from overwhelming the phone system. It’s nice to hear that not only was there deliberate thought behind it, but real behavioral research.</p>

<p>(There are similar legends, too, about the QWERTY keyboard being developed to intentionally slow down typists to avoid jamming the keys. This is <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/221/was-the-qwerty-keyboard-purposely-designed-to-slow-typists">at least controversial</a> and <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/keys1.html">probably wrong</a>.)</p>

To me the familiar inverted-T seems like the only plausible arrangement, but there were actually a handful of different options in production for a while. <a href="http://www.eldacur.com/~brons/index.html">Jim “Brons” Burrows</a> was an engineer at DEC which developed the inverted-T keypad that later became the industry standard, and <a href="http://www.eldacur.com/~brons/NerdCorner/InverseT-History.html">his first-person account of that development process</a> is a really interesting read.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bell labs" /><category term="brons" /><category term="john karlin" /><category term="keyboards" /><category term="ny times" /><category term="ui" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many around the web, I was struck last month by the obituary of Bell Labs engineer John E.
