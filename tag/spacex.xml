Last month, when Elon Musk’s privately held company SpaceX posted photos taken during a successful satellite launch, I noted that, unlike every picture NASA has ever taken, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/why-photos-of-space-should-belong-to-everyone/385681/">these wouldn’t enter the public domain immediately</a> by default. It may have been an unintended side effect of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105">the copyright rule about government works</a>, but for whatever reason the public domain grew with each space photo, and that would be stopping. That’s a bummer, and <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/02/earth-elon-please-let-public-domain-space-photos/">I called for Elon Musk to fix it</a> by dedicating his company’s new photos to the public domain.</p>

<p>This month, we’ve had a victory in two parts. First, after press inquiries and the like, SpaceX announced that it would be opening <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos/">a repository of photos on Flickr</a>, and that beyond just allowing public access, it would <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/spacex-releases-its-photos-under-creative-commons/388200/">release those photos under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>. I don’t love NonCommercial licenses for <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC">a lot of reasons</a>, but still, that was a nice show of good faith and I appreciated that a major company would take the effort.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Launch_of_Falcon_9_carrying_ASIASAT_6_16169087563.jpg" alt="Launch_of_Falcon_9_carrying_ASIASAT_6_(16169087563)" /></p>

<p>But then another remarkable thing happened. When Musk tweeted about putting those photos online, somebody replied suggesting the public domain—<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/22/8272153/elon-musk-spacex-photos-public-domain">and then Musk agreed</a>. It was a remarkable exchange, and just a few minutes later he declared that he’d changed the license.</p>

<p>There was some confusion, as Flickr doesn’t generally allow photos to be marked as truly public domain—that would require a CC0 waiver, or a declaration that the photos otherwise have no restrictions—so on that platform they were instead set to the most permissive license available, Creative Commons Attribution. Jessamyn West wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/message/why-spacex-s-photos-maybe-aren-t-public-domain-5c7f156572f5">great post</a> explaining how that meant that the photos weren’t <em>really</em> in the public domain, for some purposes.</p>

<p>But on SpaceX’s own site, they are <a href="http://www.spacex.com/media">clearly marked with a CC0 waiver</a>. And as such, they’ve been <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs_by_SpaceX">uploaded to platforms like the Wikimedia Commons</a>, where they can bear the same freedoms. This may be a small campaign—targeting just one company, and not changing any systemic policies—but the victory is real and exciting. Thank you, Elon Musk, for setting an example and helping to grow the public domain.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="elon musk" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="spacex" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an exciting time for photographs from space.

It would continue a tradition of unrestricted space photos that began with NASA’s images—necessarily public domain, coming from a U.S. government agency—but which is <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/when-spacex-takes-photos-on-a-nasa-mission-copyright-law-explodes">jeopardized when space photographs come from private companies</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/599px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17-300x300.jpg" alt="599px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17" />This is an issue I’ve been vocal about before, and with other contract photographers that NASA uses. (Like for example: it strikes me as just impossibly sad that none of the photos of the retiring shuttle being flown over the US—take <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/7088014787/">this beautiful shot over D.C.</a>, to pick just one—likely won’t be in the public domain for another century.)</p>

<p>A robust and well-documented space program is a major boon for motivating young people to study science. Images from space have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble#cite_note-NASAmarble-2">formed the basis of major social movements</a>, and been the <a href="http://sb.longnow.org/SB_homepage/WholeEarth_buton.html">target of activism campaigns</a>.</p>

<p>And just generally, it’s an incredibly valuable thing that U.S. government works go straight to the public domain. Lots of other countries don’t have that, despite the common-sense logic behind it: we, the taxpayers, already paid for the work, which requires no additional incentive to be produced. To see that value get chipped away by private deals would be tragic.</p>

<p>All this is to say, society has gotten so much out of media from space being free for all to share, and that shouldn’t end as private companies get access. Please, Elon Musk, commit to releasing photography from SpaceX into the public domain. The future will thank you.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="elon musk" /><category term="nasa" /><category term="public domain" /><category term="spacex" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It probably goes without saying that I am a strong supporter of Techdirt’s call for Elon Musk to release space photos taken by SpaceX into the public domain.
