Not much to see—it’s just a house in a residential neighborhood—but we were nearby and thought it’d be fun to make the trip. Here’s a picture of the five of us posed out in front (from left to right, that’s me, Sarah Jeong, Marcia Hofmann, Kashmir Hill, and Trevor Timm).</p>

<p>We hatched an idea to come back with sidewalk chalk, and on the day I left for the airport we stopped by and I took to the street. Here are the results.</p>

Why might a work–selfie or otherwise, be in the public domain?</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s old enough that the copyright term has lapsed. In the US that is definitely the case if the work was created before 1923, and so certainly includes <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2013/11/19/robert-cornelius-self-portrait-the-first-ever-selfie-1839/">this first-ever selfie by Robert Cornelius</a> from 1839 ((although it’s the image was probably never covered by copyright at all, given that photographs <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/10/100-years-of-cinematic-copyright/">weren’t eligible for copyright until 1865</a>.)):</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/780px-RobertCornelius.jpg" alt="780px-RobertCornelius" /></p>

<p>A selfie might also be in the public domain if it were taken by a US government employee in the course of his or her work. Not many government employees take selfies, but <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/105234/best-ever-astronaut-selfies/">astronauts definitely do</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/clay_anderson-580x384.jpg" alt="clay_anderson-580x384" /></p>

<p>What else isn’t eligible for copyright? According to <a href="http://www.copyrightcompendium.com/#202.02(b)">the Copyright Compendium, section 202.02(b)</a> and <a href="http://www.copyrightcompendium.com/#503.03(a)">section 503.03(a)</a>, works must have human authors to be eligible. Which means this selfie by a Black Macaque is not eligible, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110713/11244515079/can-we-subpoena-monkey-why-monkey-self-portraits-are-likely-public-domain.shtml">no matter what the camera owner (and his employer) insist</a>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get bummed out about how much Congress and the Courts have undermined the public domain in the US in the last several decades. But there’s still plenty to celebrate in there.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="pictures" /><category term="public domain" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In honor of the Oxford Dictionary Online selecting “selfie” as its word of the year, ((personally, I think it’s too soon to tell; historically, some of the best words appear for the first time in late November or early December.)) here are a few examples of remarkable selfies from the public domain.

<p>I took this photograph this morning from Bernal Hill, a little earlier than I would normally be awake because the dog I’m sitting for (Hi, Ace!) demands it. I’ve been up to the hill a bunch of times, and the view is still striking.</p>

<p>I’ve lived in San Francisco for a little over a year now, but I’m still frequently getting asked how I’m enjoying it. It’s a very different city from the last few places I’ve lived. But my most common answer (unless I’m very frustrated with something at the moment) is that it’s so easy here to surround yourself with beautiful scenery.</p>

<p>From this spot on Bernal Hill, you can see from the Candlestick Park and the freeway interchanges all the way across downtown and Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate, way out on the north tip of the peninsula. It’s quite a place, this city.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="pictures" /><category term="san francisco" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Walking the Ohlone Way</title><link href="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2013/01/walking-the-ohlone-way/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Walking the Ohlone Way" /><published>2013-01-02T05:18:15-05:00</published><updated>2013-01-02T05:18:15-05:00</updated><id>https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2013/01/walking-the-ohlone-way</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2013/01/walking-the-ohlone-way/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mairasutton.net/">Maira</a> and I were walking around her neighborhood in Glen Park when we stumbled across a tiny road called Ohlone Way. It’s pretty charming. It’s properly marked as a street, but the entire length is unpaved, and not much wider than a single car across. It rained a few days ago, and the ground was still a bit muddy and marked with deep tire tracks.</p>

<p><a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_20130101_145946.jpg"><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_20130101_145946.jpg" alt="Ohlone Way sign, marked by the entrance in concrete" /></a></p>

<p>The name, it turns out, is something of a pun. “Ohlone” is a name used to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohlone">some 40 different groups of Bay Area Native Americans</a>. The groups spoke different languages, had different traditions, and in some cases weren’t even in contact with each other, but have been lumped together because of their geographic proximity. Still, “Ohlone” is preferable to the unwieldy exonym “Costanoans” — derived from the Spanish name for the people — which seems to have fallen out of favor in the 60s or so.</p>

<p>In 1978, an author named Malcolm Margolin published a book documenting the lives of these people who lived in the Bay Area before Europeans arrived, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Ohlone-Way-Indian-Francisco-Monterey/dp/0930588010/"><cite>The Ohlone Way</cite></a>. That book has since become pretty widely cited, and is still in print some 35 years later. FoundSF has published <a href="http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=THE_OHLONE_WAY">an excerpt from that book that provides a good introduction.</a></p>

<p>I don’t know how to find more history about this little street in San Francisco, but I’d be surprised to find out it wasn’t named after the book. In any case, it’s worth strolling down Ohlone Way if you find yourself in the neighborhood.</p>

It’s pretty charming. It’s properly marked as a street, but the entire length is unpaved, and not much wider than a single car across. It rained a few days ago, and the ground was still a bit muddy and marked with deep tire tracks.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My sceneries from the plane window</title><link href="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/09/my-sceneries-from-the-plane-window/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My sceneries from the plane window" /><published>2012-09-23T19:13:49-04:00</published><updated>2012-09-23T19:13:49-04:00</updated><id>https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/09/my-sceneries-from-the-plane-window</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/09/my-sceneries-from-the-plane-window/"><![CDATA[<p>I was really struck by <a href="http://mairasutton.net/2012/09/sceneries-from-the-plane-window/">Maira’s “Sceneries From The Plane Window,”</a> so I decided to shoot my own on my trip back from Portland.

<p>The object in the front of the photograph is the propeller, and my arm (and bright green wrist-band) are a bit too visible in these. Most unfortunately, though, I had to put my camera away for the descent; it’s too bad, because we got an incredible aerial view of San Francisco.</p>

<p>We got that view flying into Oakland from the north, so if you are doing that, I can recommend a window seat on the right hand side.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="aerial photography" /><category term="maira sutton" /><category term="pictures" /><category term="travel" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was really struck by Maira’s “Sceneries From The Plane Window,” so I decided to shoot my own on my trip back from Portland.
