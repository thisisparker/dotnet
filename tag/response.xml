To summarize: Carr is shocked to see that the very same tech community who rallied against SOPA and PIPA is now rallying behind 37 Signals in <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/28/cant-look-away/">a case involving blatant design plagiarism</a> — down to hotlinked images — by another start-up named Curebit.</p>

<p>Clear thinkers have long complained about the hit job the content lobby have done on the language of copyright but rarely has the point been so clearly made that a muddled use of language translates into unclear and outright incorrect arguments. Carr’s accusations of hypocrisy by the tech community in this situation rest on two blatantly false premises. For one, Carr doesn’t know the difference between “infringement”, “theft”, and “plagiarism”. To quote the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it, as some argued on Twitter when I asked the question earlier, that plagiarism is different from copyright theft? No. And not least because plagiarism is copyright theft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would comfort me to know Carr is trolling here, but I’m afraid he isn’t. If you’ve ever been curious about why it’s important to use the correct words in this area, you’ve got a grade A example in Paul Carr. Let’s break it down: plagiarism is wrongful appropriation, and is not a crime. An act of plagiarism <em>can</em> also be copyright infringement, but an act of urination <em>can</em> also be public indecency, and you’d do well to know the difference. As for what “copyright theft” is here? Completely irrelevant to the case, and serves as a clunky malaprop throughout the entire piece. And just to get it out of the way, is copyright infringement theft? <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-infringement-and-theft-%E2%80%93-the-difference-110827/">No</a>, <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/11/copyright-infringement-vs-theft.html">no</a>, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100913/22513210998.shtml">no</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html">no</a>.</p>

<p>Second, instead of examining the premise that “the tech community doesn’t care about authorship” and determining it’s a straw man lobbying tactic, Carr swallows the point hook-line-and-sinker and uses it as evidence that they’re behaving hypocritically.</p>

<p>Think about it: Doesn’t this reaction serve as pretty good evidence that members of this community — many of whom produce creative content all day at their jobs — really do care about authorship? That maybe the MPAA spokespeople were wrong, and the tech community’s arguments against SOPA and PIPA as major <a href="http://ammori.org/2011/12/08/controversial-copyright-bills-would-violate-first-amendment-letters-to-congress-by-laurence-tribe-and-me/">unconstitutional</a> free speech violations that would <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/internet-inventors-warn-against-sopa-and-pipa">undermine Internet infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/proposed-copyright-bill-threatens-whistleblowing-and-human-rights">human rights efforts</a> around the world were more than just a fig leaf for the “I like free stuff”?</p>

<p>A gross conflation of terms gets you to the point where you don’t realize that both Hollywood’s complaints and their reactions look very, very different from 37 Signals’. Hollywood’s big problem is with freeloaders, unless I missed something big and they wanted to shut down these rogue sites for their roles in helping distribute scripts for shot-by-shot remakes of blockbuster films. And they’ve chosen to address that concern not by complaining on Twitter, but by pushing for backroom legislation so obviously and outrageously opposed to the public interest that the reaction from the Internet scared the otherwise lobbyist-cowed legislators into retreat.</p>

<p>It’s not like the MPAA studios haven’t tried to just appeal to social norms as a way to stop unauthorized copying, but their messages — “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU">You wouldn’t steal a car</a>” — suffer from the same lack of understanding and contempt for their users that Carr’s piece displays.</p>

<p>It seems simple to me that Carr thought this latest event was noteworthy because he doesn’t understand the issues, so every new twist and turn is unexpected. This distinction between infringement and theft everybody keeps talking about? Don’t worry, it probably doesn’t matter. The tech community’s actual articulate position? Nah, just take the MPAA’s word for what they’re saying.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="infringement" /><category term="paul carr" /><category term="plagiarism" /><category term="response" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is so much aggressively wrong with Paul Carr’s recent “Angry Nerds” piece that it is hard to know where to begin.

The problem with the “dialogue” so far, he says, is that (1) it has basically consisted of each side calling the other names, (2) which isn’t going to help now, and (3) will set a bad precedent for making new tech policy.</p>

<p>Expanding on that first point, he says that while the bill’s supporters may have kicked things off by accusing the tech community of engaging in, supporting, and profiting from piracy, that community should not respond with further name-calling and accusations of censorship. Instead, the tech sector should acknowledge the real problem with online piracy overseas and work together with the content industry to address it.</p>

<p>I really appreciate calls for civility, especially in a discussion that has gotten as heated as the one around SOPA and PROTECT IP. But as an active participant in that discussion, three things immediately popped out at me that deserve attention.</p>

<p>John wants there to be a “nuanced, technically-informed, respectful discussion/debate/conversation/working relationship” between these two parties, but doesn’t see a way that can happen. He may be right when he says that one missing piece is civility. But another is that both parties need to approach this discussion honestly. Supporters of this bill have, in <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111214/04100017081/chris-dodd-resorting-to-outright-lying-desperate-attempt-to-get-sopa-passed.shtml">example</a> after <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/how-copyright-industries-con-congress/">example</a>, demonstrated no remorse in lying outright to support their position.</p>

<p>Opponents of the bill point out when its supporters are lying, and when they seem to be <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/week-censorship">advocating for measures suited for repressive regimes</a>. Maybe these are attacks, but they are also true. While both sides may need to tone down the vitriol, there is no hope of progress until everybody first agrees to give the process enough respect to stick to the truth.</p>

<p>(I’ll acknowledge that, in some cases, the bill’s supporters may simply be misinformed; that lack of information would be a consequence of them not taking the debate seriously. Or that they’re not being dishonest, per se, but <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intellectualdishonesty">intellectually dishonest</a>. It’s hard to know without being in their head, but in any case, the point stands.)</p>

<p>John also rightly points out that we need to be thinking critically about how copyright law can and should work today, and he claims that part of that process needs to be acknowledging the real problem facing rightsholders. I agree, of course, with the first part. But I think the second needs to be examined closer. Rightsholders might only have a “real problem” in a very limited sense of the word.</p>

<p>The ease of copying can absolutely lead to missed profit opportunities. But <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/sopa-is-a-symbol-of-the-movie-industrys-failure-to-innovate/250967/">as Steve Blank points out in the Atlantic</a>, the content industry’s track record of identifying which technologies will ultimately be profitable is abysmal, and they’re also not alone in dealing with “piracy”. Every area of commerce grapples with the fact that bad actors can thwart controls, but only the content industries are willing (and able!) to destroy innovation in other sectors to control it. ((The content industry may even be better off than other industries when it comes to piracy, because the version they face — copyright infringement — <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html">isn’t even theft</a>.))</p>

<p>Combine that history with the first point — that studios and labels are willing to flat-out lie to support their points — and it becomes hard to take their “problem” seriously. The tech community isn’t denying that Internet users can download Hollywood movies off servers in Sweden, but what does that actually mean for their business? The rightsholders’ plain insincerity, the lack of real data to support their position, and their uncanny knack for attacking each new technology as it emerges conspire against the precariousness of their position.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is a point John acknowledges, these bills were not introduced in a way to foster a conversation. If the content industries were interested in a real conversation, they’d find willing participants. Trying to push through legislation that they wrote in secret with “<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57343367-281/meet-sopa-author-lamar-smith-hollywoods-favorite-republican/">Hollywood’s favorite Republican</a>“, to a Congress <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/68448.html">they’ve spent $91 million lobbying</a> this year alone, does not demonstrate a good faith effort on their part.</p>

<p>A discussion about how copyright should be shaped and enforced in the face of changing technology and norms is a good one to have. But the people who recognize the importance of technology continue to be denied the opportunity to have that conversation with the other stakeholders. Instead, we have been put on the defensive against incoming legislative U-boats. Without a doubt, a meaningful dialogue would be better now and for the future; unfortunately, our only option at the moment is to point out the glaring flaws in these proposals and keep fighting them until they sink.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="john lilly" /><category term="response" /><category term="sopa" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on his blog, John Lilly provides the best sort of analysis of the SOPA conversation — reasonable and measured.
