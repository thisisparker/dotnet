<blockquote>
  <p>People do not behave rationally around emoji. A large and growing group of people love them more than anybody should love a font, and a small and shrinking set of people think they signal the end of polite interpersonal communication. In any case, that split has fueled the reaction to this bot, and it’s something to keep in mind: when crafting the “tone” of your tweets, you can choose to make them fun, and make people like seeing them.</p>

<p>In fact, there’s a whole <a href="https://twitter.com/hugovk/lists/tiny-universe">“tiny universe” of bots</a> that tweet emoji scenes—most prominently, Katie Rose Pipkin’s amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/tiny_star_field">“tiny star fields”</a>. But as far as I could tell, none of them have trains. So I set to work putting my trains into some tiny landscapes, and quickly got something together.</p>

<p>Friday morning I “launched” the bot, by <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/708337788286992384">tweeting about it</a> from my own account. I’m not sure what reaction I expected, but it wasn’t this one: over the course of the next 24 hours, over a thousand people followed it. By 10 tweets in or so, it had surpassed <a href="https://twitter.com/pomological">@pomological</a> as my most popular bot. Over the weekend it climbed to 1,600 followers and it seems to still be on the rise.</p>

<p>Best of all though, I’m getting nice feedback from people speaking all different languages. That’s something I don’t usually get when I’m writing, but of course these “scenes”—if you can even call them that—are equally intelligible in any language. It feels really great to know that people around the world like this thing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thisisparker/choochoobot">source code is online</a>, and I’ll write up more of a how-to soon. More excitingly, I want to keep developing out the possibilities here. Even out of the idea phase, it’s still a goofy project, but it’s a fun canvas to explore some more elaborate ideas.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="bots" /><category term="emoji" /><category term="programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="trains" /><category term="twitter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a goofy idea: After a few happy-hour drinks on Thursday, I decided to write a little Python script to make emoji “trains” of random length, combining the steam engine with the two styles of rail cars.

In my opinion, the moment this became an issue was when Apple exported emoji that mostly looked white to us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After all, the Unicode Consortium only provides the list of possible emoji to platforms like Apple, Android, and Twitter — it’s up to the platforms to actually draw them. Platforms like Apple got a descriptions from the Unicode Consortium like “HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND” or “POLICE OFFICER” and they created the pictures we’re all familiar with. Because Apple was one of the first platforms to draw emoji, their versions — which feature mostly white faces — became the canon.</p>

<p>This was harder to write than I expected, but I think it’s an interesting and surprisingly convoluted issue. Hopefully this explanation helps people understand some of the forces at play here.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="emoji" /><category term="writing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at Ratter, I’ve written about how the unrecognized character symbol is showing up in an unfortunate context with the new emoji-of-color, and how this all relates to an Ur-issue of emoji racism.
