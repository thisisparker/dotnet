I’ve picked out some of my favorites in posts 101-200, below.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/pushing-perfect-forward-secrecy-important-web-privacy-protection">Pushing For Perfect Forward Secrecy, an Important Web Privacy Protection</a>, I worked with our tech folks to explain a property that actually really matters for cryptography, but at that point—in August 2013—hadn’t really been set out for lay people. Since then it’s been described even better, but for a while this post had the honor of being one of the more widely-shared explainers on the topic.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/silk-road-case-dont-blame-technology">In the Silk Road Case, Don’t Blame the Technology</a> was published the day the criminal complaint against Ross Ulbricht was released. It goes through some of the technologies that he was alleged to have used, talking about how essential they are for enabling important speech, and how they’ve been demonized before.</p>

<p>It’s more specialized, but <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/mobile-tracking-code-conduct-falls-short-protecting-consumers">Mobile Tracking Code of Conduct Falls Short of Protecting Consumers</a> was a fun combination of legal and technical talk. One of the points I got to make in there was how the space of MAC address hashes is possible to brute force, alongside general concerns about people finding retail mobile tracking creepy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/remembering-aaron">Remembering Aaron</a> was a difficult one to write, emotionally. It’s become an important thing for me to look over the work I’m doing, and see how it lines up with his ideals. This post was a chance to do that across the whole organization, and speculate what he might have thought about the developments in this space in the year since his death.</p>

<p>There’s maybe no post that I hope more will be vindicated by history than <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/how-bad-supreme-court-decision-might-have-good-constitutional-consequences">How a Bad Supreme Court Decision Could Have Good Constitutional Consequences for Copyright</a>, which is basically a short look at a law review article by Neil Netanel arguing that the Golan decision could render 1201 a violation of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>A pair of articles about TPP written 18 months apart are favorites for different reasons. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/tpps-attack-artists-termination-rights">The TPP’s Attack on Artists’ Termination Rights</a> was the first thing I co-wrote with Sarah Jeong, and was both obviously correct and intensely aggravating to people who set up camp on “the other side” of copyright issues from EFF. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/tpp-copyright-trap-our-last-stand-against-undemocratic-international-agreements">TPP’s Copyright Trap</a> is a long look at copyright terms that is one of the most widely shared things I’ve written.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/who-really-owns-your-drones">Who Really Owns Your Drones?</a> is so far my most thorough look at one of The Big Questions about DRM and connected devices. It builds on earlier posts like How DRM Harms Our Computer Security and that weird news story from February about the drone downed on the White House lawn.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="blog" /><category term="EFF" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The article I published about the (qualified) public domain victory in the Happy Birthday case this week was my 200th post on EFF’s blog Deeplinks, an event that—like the 100th post two years ago—calls for a little reflection.

(In part because there hasn’t been much media coverage of <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp">the TPP</a> at all, which in turn stems from the secrecy of the agreement—media organization unwilling to speculate about the contents or report on the secrecy itself are simply not going to cover it, which is kind of the point of the secrecy in the first place.)</p>

<p>The post hit the top of Hacker News, and some people in the discussion there (and in other places) suggested that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/opinion/a-pacific-trade-deal.html?_r=0">the Times editorial in question</a> is not in fact an endorsement, or that it’s a conditional endorsement only of a “good agreement” and without the suggestion that any particular draft of the TPP is, in fact, that. Sorry to those people, but I don’t buy that for a minute.</p>

<p>First, we’re talking about the Editorial section of the New York Times here. There’s no Twitter bio up top insisting that repeating the government line isn’t an endorsement. The entire purpose of that section is to represent the opinion of the editors; are we to believe that the editors are using this space to stake out the controversial claim that “a good agreement would be good”?</p>

<p>There’s the question of timing. Had this editorial come out, even word-for-word, at the beginning of the talks, it may not be an endorsement of the agreement but of the stated goals. But that argument doesn’t cut it just months out from the supposed completion date. Saying “Springfield needs a nuclear power plant” means one thing when the town is considering calling for bids, and quite another after Mr. Burns has broken ground. There has for at least 18 months been a process underway, and it has been outrageously secretive, and the Times does not mention that fact at all.</p>

<p>Newspaper endorsements are often explicit about using the word “endorse,” especially when talking about political candidates. It’s true that this editorial did not do so. But turning to the English definition of the word: it’s hard to imagine a layperson reading the piece and not coming away with the impression it provided support or approval of an agreement.</p>

<p>And frankly, if at this stage in the process the New York Times thinks it’s possible to produce a proverbial “good agreement” in a process that has defied transparency as brazenly as the TPP has, that’s an endorsement in itself.</p>

<p>We’re in a crucial stage of the campaign against the secret agreement that we believe—but of course cannot confirm—contains language that would absolutely be detrimental to Internet users everywhere. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/congress-must-not-fast-track-tpp-ratification">The “fast track authority” process</a>, which the Obama administration has suggested is essential to passing the agreement but which strips away one more layer of accountability, is on the rocks.</p>

<p>An endorsement from the New York Times at this stage sure looks like a favor to the administration and a way to clear opposition on the left. Without any access to the text of the agreement, that uncomfortable assumption is hard to disprove. If the Times thinks it isn’t endorsing the agreement, I’m curious to know what it thinks it did. If it’s endorsing without access to the text, that is unforgivably reckless behavior for a newspaper. And if it has access to the text but won’t publish, it has lost sight of its duty to the public interest.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="EFF" /><category term="maira sutton" /><category term="new york times" /><category term="tpp" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I helped Maira edit an excellent piece that she wrote for the EFF blog this week called “How Can the New York Times Endorse an Agreement the Public Can’t Read?” Fortunately, the article has gotten a lot of pickup, and I think it’s raising some very important questions that haven’t hit the mainstream.

One hundred strikes me as a nice big round number, averaging a little more than one a week since I started in November 2011. Here are some of my favorite posts of the first 100.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/dear-hollywood-open-letter-hardworking-men-and-women-entertainment-industries">Dear Hollywood: An Open Letter to the Hardworking Men and Women in the Entertainment Industries</a> – In the wake of SOPA (and the petty response from the top lobbyists that failed to get it passed), this letter speaks to the actual people that those lobbying groups purports to represent. I got a number of responses from people who work in the film industry, including an email from a director whose work I really admire, and it was generally pretty fun to write this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging">Google Abandons Open Standards for Instant Messaging</a> – As Google is switching from Talk to Hangouts as its instant message platform, it’s also dropping support for federated XMPP connections. That’s a pretty technical issue, so I wanted to make sure that I communicated it in a way that expressed the significance of the issue to people who aren’t familiar with all the specifics. I got a lot of feedback while drafting, and I’m proud of the way this turned out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/why-isnt-gatsby-public-domain">Why Isn’t Gatsby in the Public Domain?</a> – This was maybe my favorite to actually write, as I got the idea one evening and whipped through it the next morning in a generally really enjoyable situation. Every piece we post on Deeplinks has had at least two sets of eyes, but the person I worked for to edit this one is my favorite.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/these-are-critical-fixes-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act">Critical Fixes for the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> – For weeks after <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2013/01/goodbye-aaron-swartz-1986-2013/">Aaron Swartz’s death</a>, EFF attorneys worked with other prominent legal experts and even got feedback from Congressional staffers on how to improve the statutory language in the CFAA. But after a few weeks, there was still no generally readable summary of the changes that need to be made. This was my intro-to-CFAA-reform document in the form of a call to action. I was paid the highest possible compliment on this one: copies were printed out and left on every seat at Aaron’s DC memorial service.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/best-practices-respect-mobile-user-bill-rights">Mobile User Privacy Bill of Rights</a> – These are some basic rights that any phone user deserves, but that carriers, app developers, and even OS makers have at times undermined. Most can be addressed by the app developers, though, which is why this is targeted at them in addition to us users ourselves. When the California AG <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/california-attorney-general-releases-mobile-privacy-recommendations">released its guidelines for mobile privacy</a>, it tracked this list of rights pretty closely.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/congress-shouldnt-debate-copyright-reality-free-zone">Congress Shouldn’t Debate Copyright in a Reality-Free Zone</a> – Many of the facts that should inform the copyright debate are as undisputed as they could possibly be, but Congress refuses to engage in an evidence-based debate. There’s a lot of political pressure on them not to, in fact. But really, copyright is fundamentally an economic policy, and its stated goal can be measured and achieved. We’ll get real, meaningful reform when Congress stops debating copyright in a reality-free zone.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="blog" /><category term="EFF" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the EFF “Deeplinks” blog, I’ve just published my 100th post, an intro to the cryptographic property of perfect forward secrecy.

<p>The idea behind copyright is simple — it is supposed to be a balance in the service of the public interest. There’s a trade-off: for accepting a restriction on certain speech, the public benefits from the production of more new creative works each year. That delicate equation is complicated by many factors, and the right policy should find the balance of copyright scope and duration, limitations and exceptions like fair use, and the appropriate remedies in case of infringement.</p>

<p>But in fact, copyright policies almost universally lack the serious cost-benefit analysis that must precede any evidence-based proposal. And indeed, while the unintended costs are clear to anybody who has observed <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/blacklist-bills-ripe-abuse">abuse of, say, the DMCA takedown system</a>, the evidence that these policies create incentives — or even prevent harm — is less forthcoming.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="https://twitter.com/normative">Julian Sanchez</a> of the Cato Institute posted <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/talking-about-trade-offs-between-liberty-and-security-begs-the-question/">a thought-provoking piece that questions the similar calculation at the core of national security rhetoric</a>. In the area of security, he asks, are we actually getting a “trade-off” for all the costs we incur to the country’s budget and our personal liberty? Sanchez convincingly argues that we haven’t been working towards a balance between those two ideas at all. Liberty is consistently discarded in the name of “security,” and the resulting policies don’t actually make us safer. A dialogue that focuses only on striking a balance between these two ideas fails to address more fundamental questions about our policy.</p>

<p>So, too, with copyright. The right copyright policy should serve the constitutional purpose of promoting “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause">the progress of science and the useful arts</a>” while respecting the ideals of the First Amendment. The need for such a balance is well recognized from all corners of the copyright discussion. In a post about the misguided Supreme Court opinion in <em>Golan v. Holder</em> this January, for example, EFF referred to the “<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/supreme-court-gets-it-wrong-golan-v-holder-public-domain-mourns">traditional copyright balance between public and private interests</a>“; and while EFF doesn’t always see eye-to-eye on copyright issues with content lobby groups like the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), its chief executive Cary Sherman has also described <a href="https://www.riaa.com/blog.php?content_selector=riaa-news-blog&amp;blog_selector=Viacom_YouTube&amp;blog_type=&amp;news_month_filter=6&amp;news_year_filter=2010">“the careful balance struck within” copyright law</a>.</p>

<p>It makes sense, then, that one typical response to bad copyright policy developments — and there are many — is to say that those developments skew this balance the wrong way, favoring the incentives and rewards for rightsholders more than is necessary to maximize creative production. But that approach overlooks the fact that many of the worst copyright proposals, like those that come out of content lobbying groups like the RIAA and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) do worse than a skewed balance. Rather, they fail to strike any kind of balance at all, curtailing speech and fundamental online rights without a corresponding increase in the incentive to create new works.</p>

<p>By and large, in the legislature, in the courtroom, in the White House, and in the backroom negotiations for international treaties, balance does not seem to be the real goal. This year’s protests against SOPA and ACTA were certainly historic demonstrations of online activism, but those proposed laws were just the latest in a long line. Even as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/acta-victory-europe-and-what-lies-ahead">ACTA met defeat in Europe</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/21st-century-agreement-is-really-best-way">Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) was being negotiated</a> with industry representatives behind closed doors, with guardians of the public interest on the outside. SOPA was an <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/10/sopa-hollywood-finally-gets-chance-break-internet/">egregious and over-the-top wishlist of Hollywood demands</a>, but it was hardly new: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/protect-ip-act-coica-redux">its Senate counterpart, PIPA</a>, was a re-write of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/censorship-internet-takes-center-stage-online">a bill from two years earlier called COICA</a>. And Congress has passed dozens of other one-sided copyright laws over the last thirty years.</p>

<p>If it were simply a matter of striking the wrong balance, SOPA’s cost in terms of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/proposed-copyright-bill-threatens-whistleblowing-and-human-rights">threatening human rights</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/how-pipa-and-sopa-violate-white-house-principles-supporting-free-speech">curtailing freedom of speech</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/truth-about-economics-behind-blacklist-bills">damaging the economy</a> would have to be offset by gains to the content lobby backing the bill. It wouldn’t be the <em>right</em> trade-off, but it would make sense in the context of a balance. In reality, though, the benefits for the content lobby simply weren’t there. In January, Sanchez himself <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/how-copyright-industries-con-congress/">calculated that the size of the foreign “pirate” movie market targeted at Americans</a> — the kind of activity SOPA was written to address — was orders of magnitude below the MPAA claims. And for their part, the RIAA recently revealed in <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/leaked-riaa-report-sopapipa-ineffective-tool-against-music-piracy-120727/">a leaked report from April</a> that despite its public rhetoric, it felt SOPA was “not likely to have been [an] effective tool for music” even if it had passed.</p>

<p>Similarly, when the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act — sometimes called the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” because it kept the world’s most famous rodent out of the public domain — was challenged in the Supreme Court, <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/eldredvashcroft/supct/amici/economists.pdf">some of the world’s leading economists lined up in a brief</a> [pdf] to question the premise that the public benefited from retroactive term extension at all. Once again, the costs to the public are clear: we all suffer from a poorer public domain with no clear gains in return. Worse, these examples are the rule and not the exception. Many elements of policy today — from <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca/">DMCA’s problematic section 1201</a> to the unconstitutional <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/02/ice-seizures-raising-new-speech-concerns">ICE seizures of websites</a> — and dozens more failed proposals — like the “<a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-946316.html?tag=politech">Hollywood Hacking bill</a>” or the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/broadcast-flag">broadcast flag</a> — fit this pattern.</p>

<p>Compared to the trade-off of security and liberty, the question at the heart of copyright policy is an easy one: How do we optimize the incentive to create new works while minimizing the cost to our freedom of speech and ability to innovate? Unfortunately, sane policy developments that work toward this end are all too rare.</p>]]></content><author><name>Parker Higgins</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><category term="copyright" /><category term="EFF" /><category term="julian sanchez" /><category term="policy" /><category term="security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is cross-posted from the EFF Deeplinks blog.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">April Fool’s Day EFFector</title><link href="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/04/april-fools-day-effector/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="April Fool’s Day EFFector" /><published>2012-04-03T01:20:01-04:00</published><updated>2012-04-03T01:20:01-04:00</updated><id>https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/04/april-fools-day-effector</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thisisparker.github.io/dotnet/2012/04/april-fools-day-effector/"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote much of <a href="https://www.eff.org/effector/25/10">the April Fool’s Day edition</a> of <a href="https://www.eff.org/effector/">EFF’s EFFector newsletter</a>, which we sent out to our subscribers yesterday.
