  <p>I’ve been attending (and livetweeting) the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/stakes-are-high-oracle-v-google-public-has-already-lost-big">Oracle v. Google jury trial</a> for the last two weeks, and have had a lot of conversations and made a lot of jokes about it. One joke that went surprisingly well was an image I made and tweeted without context:</p>

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

<p>In fact, the picture got enough retweets and replies that I decided to make <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/733102946188066818">stickers</a>. And <a href="https://teespring.com/you-wouldnt-reimplement-an-api">t-shirts</a>. And each of those things have gotten more attention than I expected. It’s been really exciting! I don’t have a distribution plan for the stickers besides handing them out in person (and self-addressed stamped envelopes to me at EFF), but there will be more than 300 t-shirts out there in the world. That blows my <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/01/making-alice-bob-tees/">Alice &amp; Bob design</a> out of the water.</p>

<p>All this for being a pretty esoteric design. For one thing, the API reimplementation issue being litigated in Oracle is pretty arcane. For another, it relies on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU">an anti-piracy reference that’s a decade-plus old</a> at this point.</p>

<p>The shirts will be donezo Monday evening—if anybody wants to print their own, here are the high-res source files you can send to a printer or put on a screen yourself. (The first one is white on transparent, so you have to change the background to see it.) I’d love to see your take on it!</p>
