  <h2 class="post-title">Rhyming &#8220;who phrases&#8221; from New York Times obituary headlines</h2>
  <time datetime="2016-10-12T02:11:58-04:00" class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</time>
  <p>Many obituary headlines follow a standard formula: “Firstname Lastname, Who You Know From That One Thing, Dies at Age.” It’s a tendency I’ve counted on before when extracting names from obituaries for <a href="https://foiathedead.org/">FOIA The Dead</a>, but tonight it also got me thinking about the “who phrase”: the relative clause that condenses a lifetime of context into a handful of words.</p>

<p>I decided to pull out the “who phrases” from about 1000 headlines over the past year, and using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pronouncing"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pronouncing</code></a>, arrange them to rhyme (if not yet to meter). It’s poetry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>who made the dallas cowboys cheerleaders a global brand,<br />
who built and ruled world soccer with firm hand,<br />
whose radio show twanged for decades,<br />
who fought racial barriers in building trades,<br />
who delivered in the clutch,<br />
who wrote adolescent novels with a personal touch,<br />
whose b-1 bomber recast the cold war,<br />
who fictionalized medicine’s absurdity and gore,<br />
who promoted n.w.a. and gangsta rap,<br />
who bridged racial gap,<br />
who chronicled his cancer fight,<br />
who set ‘the wicker man’ cult alight,<br />
who embraced gonzo journalism,<br />
who lost his prime to racism,<br />
who led sicilian mafia clan,<br />
who took aim at iran,<br />
who shaped venture capitalism,<br />
who shifted to optimism,<br />
who wrote of colonialism and racism,<br />
who preached pacifism,<br />
who won a round-the-world race,<br />
who quit in pentagon papers case,<br />
who wrote of madness and isolation,<br />
who helped turn wlir into a radio destination,<br />
who helped pave way for head start,<br />
who elevated blown glass to fine art,<br />
whose furniture evoked sensuality,<br />
who examined puerto rican identity,<br />
who saw literary criticism as art,<br />
who gave the rolling stones their start,<br />
whose bleak fiction won the booker prize,<br />
who shaped foreign ties,<br />
who put the @ sign in email,<br />
who shaped geometries on a bold scale.</p>
