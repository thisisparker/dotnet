  <time datetime="2015-01-19T01:20:08-05:00" class="post-date">19 Jan 2015</time>
  <p>I wanted a t-shirt in the style of the famous <a href="http://www.experimentaljetset.nl/archive/john-paul-ringo-george">Experimental Jetset Beatles shirt</a>, but with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters">traditional Alice &amp; Bob placeholder names</a> from crypto discussions. There were a few options for similar things—Bits of Freedom in the Netherlands has <a href="https://www.tjunk.com/nl/Producten/product/558/productvariant/374/Alice-Bob-Zwart">one that has Alice and Bob but also intelligence officials</a>, and there are <a href="http://www.zerodayclothing.com/products/aliceandbob/aliceandbob.php">other designs online</a>—but none was quite what I wanted.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was easy to whip together a pretty convincing looking chunky white Helvetica list of names. From there, I used a company called Teespring, which lets you pick the printing threshold and retail cost. At first I just made <a href="http://teespring.com/crypto-jetset-alice-bob">the cut I wanted for myself</a>—white text on a black men’s American Apparel shirt—but a bunch of my friends asked <a href="http://teespring.com/crypto-jetset-alice-bob-w">for women’s cuts</a>, and it’s very clear to me in retrospect I should’ve made them in the first place.</p>

<p><img src="https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/front.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Both campaigns “tipped” in the first day online, so men’s and women’s t-shirts will be printed in the next few weeks. So far, 40 shirts have been sold—it’s definitely kind of remarkable to think that sprung from my off-hand idea.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten other shirts from Teespring and the quality is high, so I’m looking forward to wearing it. If you want one of these, get it quick!</p>
