  <p>Three years ago, in the wake of the SOPA blackouts, the RIAA chairman and CEO Cary Sherman penned a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/opinion/what-wikipedia-wont-tell-you.html">strange sour grapes op-ed in the <em>New York Times</em></a>. He claimed that the overwhelmingly popular position against the proposal was based on lies, that “neutral” sites like Google and Wikipedia were violating their integrity by taking a stance at all, and most tellingly, that “misinformation may be a dirty trick, but it works.”</p>

<p>He would know!</p>

<p>In any case, there’s now a single-serving site dedicated to preserving that message. Take it from the RIAA: <a href="http://misinformation.works">misinformation.works</a>.</p>
